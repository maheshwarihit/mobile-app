# Project: VAgeWell Care — Module 1
> Standalone mobile PWA built to `requirements.txt`. NOT run through the global 13-step pipeline
> (per user direction: build to the requirements file, don't force the org CLAUDE.md ceremony).

## Architecture (locked)
- **Supabase-native**, no backend service. **One app** — `mobile/` (Expo/React Native) — covers all
  three roles (client, caregiver/leaf_node, admin) against one Supabase project + `shared/` data layer.
  The former separate `web/` (Next.js) staff/admin portal was merged into `mobile/` and then **deleted**
  (user, 2026-08-10 — see "single mobile app" round below); every mention of `web/` in the change log
  below is historical, describing the app as it was before that merge, not current state.
- Auth: phone + 6-digit SMS OTP, `auth.uid()`, RLS, 72h session. Role (read after verify) decides which
  shell inside the one app an account lands in — `RootNavigator` routes admin/leaf_node/patient to their
  own tab set; RLS remains the real access boundary regardless of which shell renders.
- Admin booking notification (R3.4): **removed** (user, 2026-07-21). No email / edge fn — the payment
  proof lands in the private `payment-proofs` bucket and the admin reviews & clears it from the dashboard.
- Excel/CSV export (`liveSheetRows()` in `shared/src/export.ts`): dead code as of the `web/` deletion —
  no screen in `mobile/` calls it (live-sheet/CSV export was out of scope for the mobile ops build, see
  the round below). Left in place rather than deleted, matching this project's own precedent for
  superseded-but-harmless leftovers (0017, 0024); safe to remove in a future cleanup pass.
- Roles: `patient` / `admin` / `leaf_node` (`staff` retired, see 0021).

## Dropped (not in requirements)
Shared Feedback system · shared `employees`/`apps` auth · `model_configs`/LLM-admin screens ·
Redux Toolkit · Cloud-Run/pipeline mandate. (Design system UI kit is kept — genuinely reusable.)

## Decisions log
- **CF-1 → RESOLVED:** Supabase Auth (phone+OTP+RLS), NOT shared employees/apps. (user, 2026-07-21)
- **Backend → RESOLVED:** Supabase-native; export client-side. (user, 2026-07-21)
- **GO-2 (channel) → SUPERSEDED:** was Email (Resend/SendGrid); admin notification removed entirely. (user, 2026-07-21)
- **R3.4 email alert → REMOVED:** deleted the `notify-admin` edge fn, DB webhook, config block, all
  email/webhook env vars, and the `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` / `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` constants. Admin reviews the
  uploaded proof + clears payment from the dashboard (pull-based, not push). (user, 2026-07-21)
- **GO-3 (roles) → RESOLVED:** patient/staff/admin. (user, 2026-07-21)

## Open items (defaults folded in — adjustable, do NOT treat as final)
- **GO-1** service catalog: 4 services. Physio Therapy ₹1,500 confirmed by the client (2026-07-24, migration
  0007). Nutrition / Para-Medical / Mental Wellbeing ₹800 still unconfirmed. One service per booking.
- **GO-4** OTP expiry/resend limits: Supabase defaults; dev fixed test codes in `config.toml`.
- **GO-5** rejection flow: rejected proof → `pending` (re-upload). Private bucket, 5 MB, png/jpg/webp.
- **GO-6** multi-day = consecutive (`start_date` + `num_days`).
- **GO-7** dependents: no hard cap; required Name/Age/Relationship/Contact.

## Build status — ALL PHASES COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 0 — scaffold, config, PWA, hygiene
- [x] Phase 1 — shared contract + schema + seed
- [x] Phase 2 — functions/triggers, RLS+grants, storage
- [x] Phase 3 — notify-admin edge function + webhook template  *(later REMOVED per user — R3.4 dropped)*
- [x] Phase 4 — frontend shell + DS + PWA
- [x] Phases 5–12 — all 8 screens + modals
- [x] Phase 13 — typecheck (0 errors) + production build (green) + security scan

## Verified locally
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors. `next build` → all 10 routes compile & prerender.
- Secret scan: no service-role/secret in frontend; only NEXT_PUBLIC URL+ANON_KEY exposed.

## NOT runnable in this env (needs user action)
- No Docker / Postgres here → migrations + RLS + OTP + storage NOT executed. Run `supabase start`
  + `supabase db reset` on a machine with Docker, or link a hosted Supabase project.

## Known deferrals (documented, not blockers)
- Services catalog is seeded + DB/Studio-editable (RLS `svc_write_admin` supports a future admin UI);
  no dedicated Services-admin screen (not in the 8-screen PDF).
- `middleware.ts` works but Next 16 deprecates the name in favour of `proxy.ts` (warning only).
- Fixed a schema bug during build: `chk_method_status` now allows `direct → paid` (cash at visit).

## Post-build audit remediation (2 deep audits: frontend + data layer)
Audit verdict: fully wired, no stubs/mock/dead buttons; transactional core verified correct. Fixed:
- [x] BUG: `useMyBookings` now filters `.eq(account_id, uid)` (staff tab was showing all bookings).
- [x] Added missing CHECK constraints on `how_heard` + `relationship` (were bare text).
- [x] Bounded `num_days` (1–60) and `time_slot` (06:00–21:00) at the DB.
- [x] R3.5 server-side gate: booking snapshot trigger rejects insert if profile has no `full_name`.
- [x] Freeze `payment_proof_path` once `payment_status='paid'` (no post-settlement swaps).
- [x] Secured `notify-admin` edge fn with `x-webhook-secret` (NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET) + empty-key dev fallback.
      *(superseded 2026-07-21 — the entire notify-admin email feature was later removed.)*
- [x] Pruned dead code (useBooking, loginSchema, paymentSchema, titleCase, BookingAlertPayload, unused import).
Re-verified: `tsc` 0 errors, `next build` green, secret scan clean, 0 dangling refs.

## Change round — admin + patient updates (user, 2026-07-22)
Implemented against `tsc` (0 errors). Metro/DB run + `0006` migration still pending on the user's machine.
- [x] **Services catalog swapped** → 4 services: Nutrition ₹800, Physio Therapy ₹1200, Para-Medical ₹800,
      Mental Wellbeing ₹800. New `supabase/migrations/0006_services_catalog.sql` deactivates the old 6
      (bookings.service_id is ON DELETE RESTRICT — can't delete) + upserts the 4. Mirrored in
      `supabase/seed.sql`, `supabase/install_all.sql`, and `SEED_SERVICES` in `shared/src/constants.ts`.
      **Requires applying 0006 (or `db reset`) on Supabase — not run in this env.**
- [x] **CSV/Excel download fixed on web** — `mobile/src/lib/export.ts` was native-only (expo-file-system +
      expo-sharing no-op on web → silent no-download). Added a `Platform.OS === "web"` Blob+anchor branch
      (DOM reached via `globalThis as any`); generalized `downloadSheet(rows, bookType, sheet, fileBase)`.
- [x] **DateField** rewritten as an in-app month-calendar `Modal` (was `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`,
      which doesn't render on web). Same props → DOB (ProfileScreen) + appointment start_date unchanged.
      Package still installed but no longer imported in code.
- [x] **Admin Payment Proofs module** — `mobile/src/screens/admin/AdminPaymentProofsScreen.tsx` (name +
      screenshot thumbnail, batch-signed URLs; taps open the existing `PaymentReviewModal`). Registered in
      `AdminNavigator` + `AdminStackParamList`; dashboard button added.
- [x] **Live Sheet = Medical records** — `useAllClinicalRecords` (shared) + Appointments/Medical toggle on
      `LiveSheetScreen` + `exportClinicalToCSV`. Staff RLS `clin_select` already permits reading all rows.
- [x] **Vitals entry gated to Para-Medical** — `AdminBookingCard` shows the "Vitals" action only when
      `service_name === PARA_MEDICAL_SERVICE`.
- [x] **Patient Health record trimmed** — `VitalsView` now shows only Sugar (glucose) + Blood Group tiles;
      history collapses to those two, drops empty "Record" rows, keeps the date. (BP/SpO2/conditions hidden.)
- **Not changed (clarified with user):** Role dropdown kept in `AdminPatientProfileScreen` (item 3); admin
      member-edit medical section kept (item 6 — the admin *profile* screen already shows no health record).

## Change round — client feedback PDF (user, 2026-07-24)
Source: `VAgeWell Care - Feedback Notes (1).pdf`. Verified with `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) **and**
`expo export --platform web` (bundle green, logo + favicon emitted). **`0007` migration still pending
on the user's Supabase.**
- [x] **New logo** — `mobile/assets/logo.png` (client-supplied, 300×282, opaque white bg). New
      `ui/BrandLogo.tsx` renders it in a white rounded chip (the chip absorbs the baked-in white
      background — no keying, no matte fringe). Replaces the HeartPulse chip on Landing/Login/Register;
      also `app.json` `icon` + `web.favicon`. *Known cosmetic debt: source is non-square and < 1024px,
      so the app icon is padded/soft. Swapping in a 1024px square export is a one-file replacement.*
- [x] **Brand mark colour swapped** — Landing now reads `VAgeWell` teal + `CARE` black (was inverse).
- [x] **Copy** — Register subtitle "Your Care Journey Starts Here", name placeholder "Name", label "Age";
      Login "Together, We Move Towards Better Health."; Admin login "Together, we manage care, support
      people, and create a healthier future"; Services "Our services" / "Choose a service to begin your
      care journey."; Appointment "Request Personalized Care"; Appointments subtitle "Your Bookings";
      booking cards read `Patient <name>` (name in brand teal) on both patient + admin sides.
- [x] **Physio Therapy ₹1,200 → ₹1,500** — new `supabase/migrations/0007_physio_price.sql` (idempotent).
      Mirrored in `seed.sql`, `install_all.sql` (its services block is now an **upsert**, not
      `do nothing`, so re-running it repairs a stale catalog) and `SEED_SERVICES`. `0006` left untouched
      — it may already be applied; 0007 supersedes it. Existing bookings keep ₹1,200 (price is snapshotted).
- [x] **Booking completion added** — `useCompleteBooking()` (open → closed) + a **Complete** action on
      `AdminBookingCard`. No migration: the 0002 update guard and `bk_update` RLS already allowed staff
      `open → closed`; nothing in the UI had ever used it. `BOOKING_STATUS_META.closed` now labels
      "Completed" (was "Closed") to match the action.
- [x] **Patient Appointments** — only `open` bookings list; the most recent closed/cancelled one renders
      as a read-only **Last appointment** card (deliberately not `PatientBookingCard`, which carries
      Cancel/re-upload affordances).
- [x] **Admin Patients search now includes dependents** — new `useAllFamilyMembers(enabled)` +
      `qk.familyMembersAll`. Account holders and family members share one name-sorted, searchable list;
      dependents carry a "Family member" pill and tap straight through to `AdminMemberEdit`.
- [x] **Live sheet merged into one sheet** — Appointments/Medical toggle removed. `liveSheetRows()`
      in `mobile/src/lib/export.ts` emits the client's 18 columns + Booking ID / Symptom Brief / Created.
      Vitals are folded per subject taking the **most recent non-null value per field** (staff write one
      dated row per visit, so `records[0]` alone would blank earlier fields). Payment/appointment status
      use the human labels. Both the CSV download and the dashboard Excel export now call the same
      builder, so they are byte-identical.
- [x] **Profile** — vitals History list removed; Sugar + Blood Group tiles kept.
- **Cascade cleanup:** `clinicalRows` / `exportClinicalToCSV` / `ClinicalRecordWithNames` deleted;
      `useAllClinicalRecords` dropped its 3-way name join (nothing consumed it once the medical sheet
      went); `useAllBookings` gained `relationship / age / contact_phone` on the dependent embed and
      `age` on the account embed.

### Re-check pass (same day) — 4 issues found and fixed
- **`0007_physio_price.sql` was written empty** (0 bytes of SQL). Rewritten + content verified. *Lesson:
  read back any generated file that nothing else compiles or imports — `tsc` can't catch an empty .sql.*
- **`install_all.sql` upsert didn't retire the old catalog.** As a repair script it would have left the
  original 6 placeholder services active alongside the new 4. Now does `set active = false` first,
  matching 0006.
- **Profile tiles could blank a known value.** With History gone, `records[0]` was the only source — a
  visit that recorded sugar but not blood group hid a blood group captured earlier. `VitalsView` now
  reads the most recent **non-null value per field**, same rule as the live sheet.
- **Dashboard fetched the whole vitals ledger on every load** just to arm the Export button. Now
  `useAllClinicalRecords(false)` + `refetch()` on click (verified in query-core: `refetch()` calls
  `fetch()` with no `enabled` gate). Also fixed the patient empty state, which said "No appointments
  yet" to someone whose visits were merely finished.

## Change round — client feedback Doc2.pdf (user, 2026-07-24)
Six notes on admin dashboard / patient Appointments / live sheet. Verified `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors)
and `expo export --platform web` (bundle green). **`0008` migration pending on the user's Supabase.**
- [x] **Cancelled bookings are out of the payment workflow.** `AdminBookingCard` drops the **Review**
      action and the payment pill when `booking_status === 'cancelled'` (a cancelled visit showing
      "Pay at Visit" was the client's complaint); the divider row is skipped when no actions remain.
      `PaymentReviewModal` renders read-only for a cancelled booking — the proof image stays, the
      Reject / Mark Paid pair becomes a notice + Close. That matters because the modal is *also*
      opened from `AdminPaymentProofsScreen`, so gating the card alone left a second path.
      New `supabase/migrations/0008_cancelled_payment_guard.sql` closes the same hole in the DB:
      0002's `verify_payment` / `reject_payment` gated on `payment_status` only, so a cancelled
      booking could still be settled. Mirrored into `install_all.sql`. `create or replace` preserves
      the 0002 ACLs, so the revoke/grant block is not repeated.
- [x] **Dashboard ordered by appointment date desc** — `useAllBookings` ordered `created_at desc`
      while every card/sheet row renders `start_date`, so the visible dates looked unsorted. Now
      `.order(start_date desc).order(created_at desc)`. Intentional cascade: payment proofs, live
      sheet and both exports are newest-appointment-first too.
- [x] **Dashboard search covers services** — `filtered` also matches `service_name`; label is now
      "Search by patient or service".
- [x] **Last appointment = completed only** — `DashboardScreen` took every non-open booking, so a
      *cancelled* one could headline "Last appointment". Narrowed to `booking_status === 'closed'`;
      cancelled bookings now leave the patient's tab entirely (confirmed with the user). Empty state
      keys off `hasAny` rather than `last`, so anyone who has ever booked reads "No upcoming".
- [x] **Back control between Appointment and Payment** — the patient tabs run `headerShown: false`
      and `PageHeader` had no back slot, so Payment was a dead end on web/PWA and iOS. `PageHeader`
      gained an optional `onBack` (ChevronLeft, mirrors `AdminHeader`); wired on Payment and, for the
      same dead end, Appointment. **Payment suppresses it while `busy` and once `createdId` is set** —
      the booking row already exists at that point (insert OK, proof upload failed), and a second pass
      through a freshly-mounted PaymentScreen would insert a duplicate.
- [x] **Live sheet search over all data** — `FormInput` + a "Showing N of M rows" counter; the filter
      matches each row's whole value set as text, so it covers every column including Booking ID and
      Symptom Brief. `exportAppointmentsToCSV` couldn't see the filter (it re-derived rows from
      `bookings`), so it was replaced by `exportRowsToCSV(rows)` taking pre-built rows; the button
      downloads exactly what's listed and is disabled on an empty result. Dashboard **Export** is
      untouched and still exports everything.
- [x] **New logo** — client's Photoroom cutout (395×418, real alpha) replaces `mobile/assets/logo.png`
      and the repo-root source copy. Because the mark is now transparent, a transparent app icon would
      render black-backed on iOS, so `app.json` `icon` points at a **new generated
      `mobile/assets/icon.png`** — 1024×1024, mark centred at 78% on white. That also clears the old
      "icon is padded/soft" debt. `web.favicon` stays on the transparent `logo.png` (adapts to the tab
      background). `BrandLogo`'s white chip is kept as a deliberate badge; its comment no longer
      claims the source has a baked-in white background.

## Bugfix — "Save profile goes to an undefined page" (user, 2026-07-24)
Patient **Profile → Edit details → Save** on the web/PWA: browser tab title flipped to the literal
string `undefined`, splash flashed, user was dumped on the Services tab. Frontend-only, no migration.
Verified `tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) + `expo export --platform web` (bundle green).

Root cause chain (verified against the installed `@react-navigation` v7 source, not from memory):
`saveBio` → `refreshProfile()` → `AuthProvider.loadProfile()` sets the **global** `profileLoading`
→ `RootNavigator`'s gate `if (loading || (user && profileLoading))` returned `<SplashScreen/>`,
unmounting the whole navigator. Two symptoms fell out of that one unmount:
1. `AppNavigator` remounted **fresh**, so the tab stack rebuilt from scratch and landed on the
   initial route (`ServicesTab`) — the "thrown off Profile" half.
2. With no navigator mounted, `NavigationContainer` still runs `useDocumentTitle`; its default
   formatter is `options?.title ?? route?.name` and `getCurrentRoute()` returns `undefined`
   (`BaseNavigationContainer.js`: `state == null → undefined`), so it executed
   `document.title = undefined` → the tab literally read **"undefined"**. The "undefined page" half.

- [x] **`RootNavigator`: gate the splash on *resolution*, not on *loading*.** Now
      `profileResolved = !!profile && profile.id === user?.id`, and the splash only shows while the
      **current** user's profile is still unknown. Keeps the original anti-flicker intent (patient
      shell must not flash before the role resolves) but a background refetch no longer tears down
      the tree. Keyed on `profile.id === user.id` rather than a bare `!profile` so a stale profile
      from a previous account can't count as resolved when a different-role account signs in.
- [x] **`App.tsx`: explicit `documentTitle` formatter** — `options?.title ?? "VAgeWell Care"`.
      Belt-and-braces: the splash is still legitimately rendered on cold start and sign-out, and
      both wrote `undefined` before. Also stops internal route ids (`AdminMemberEdit`) leaking into
      the browser tab/history. Keep the string in sync with `expo.name` in `app.json` by eye.
- [x] **`ProfileScreen.saveBio`**: `setEditing(false)` now runs *before* `void refreshProfile()`
      instead of awaiting it — polish, so the read-only rows appear without a second round-trip.
- **Wider fix, same root cause:** Supabase fires `onAuthStateChange` on `TOKEN_REFRESHED` (~hourly)
  and `AuthProvider` re-ran `loadProfile` there too, so the app used to remount and reset to the
  initial tab mid-session on a routine token refresh. That is gone as well.
- **Deliberately not touched:** `AdminMemberEditScreen.save()` — it never calls `refreshProfile`, so
  it cannot hit this bug (confirmed with the user that the admin path is not the reported symptom).
  It does carry a separate latent issue worth its own round: `finish()` (toast + `goBack()`) fires
  off the **clinical** mutation only, so a failed *bio* update still reports "Record saved".

## Context handoff
Latest: the **"Save profile → undefined page" bugfix** (2026-07-24) is implemented — `tsc --noEmit`
0 errors, web bundle green. Frontend-only, no migration, so it needs **no DB work** — just a runtime
click-through on the web build: Profile → Edit details → Save must keep the tab title
"VAgeWell Care" (never "undefined"), stay mounted on the Profile tab with the form collapsed to the
updated read-only rows, and no splash flash. Regression to re-check: hard-reload as a patient **and**
as a staff/admin account — the splash must still hold until the role resolves, with no flicker of
the patient tabs before the admin stack appears.

Doc2.pdf feedback round (2026-07-24) is implemented — `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, web bundle green, the
new logo + generated icon bundle correctly. **Needs the user's machine:**
1. Apply `supabase/migrations/0006` (if never run), `0007_physio_price.sql` **and the new
   `0008_cancelled_payment_guard.sql`** — or `supabase db reset`.
   Verify: `select name, price_per_day from services where active` → Physio Therapy = 1500; then cancel
   a booking and call `select verify_payment('<id>')` → must raise *"booking is cancelled"* with
   `payment_status` unchanged.
2. Runtime click-through (no Docker/Postgres in the build env): cancelled card shows only the
   `Cancelled` pill with no Review; dashboard lists newest appointment date first; searching "physio"
   filters by service; live-sheet search + CSV row count; the back chevron returns from Payment to a
   still-filled Appointment form; admin **Complete** → booking leaves the patient list and reappears
   as *Last appointment*, while a cancelled one disappears.
3. The client's original `WhatsApp Image 2026-07-24 at 14.27.26-Photoroom.png` is still sitting in the
   repo root — delete it if you don't want the raw drop kept alongside `logo.png`.

Earlier context still current: **R3.4 admin email alert removed (2026-07-21)** — the `notify-admin`
edge fn, `supabase/webhooks.sql`, its config block, all email/webhook env vars and the
`ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` / `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` constants are deleted; the admin reviews the uploaded proof
and clears payment from the dashboard instead. To run: follow README (supabase start → db reset →
`npm run start` in `mobile/`). Confirm the founding-admin phone in `supabase/seed.sql`.
GO-1 is now settled for Physio (₹1,500); GO-4/5/6/7 still carry documented defaults — confirm before
production.

## Change round — split into two apps (user, 2026-07-28)
User direction: "for customer (patient login) mobile app and staff, leaf node, admin are in the web
app" — confirmed as a genuine split into two separately deployable codebases (not just a description
of the existing single app). Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors + `expo export --platform web`
bundles (2816 modules); `web` `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors, `eslint` 0 errors/warnings, `next build` green
(11 routes). **No DB migration** — reuses the existing schema/RLS/RPCs as-is; this is a frontend split.

- [x] **New `web/` — Next.js 16 staff/admin portal.** Scaffolded via `create-next-app` (App Router,
      Tailwind v4, TS). Same Supabase phone+OTP login (`/login` → `/verify`); a patient phone number
      that lands here is signed back out with a message (RLS is the real boundary — this is UX only,
      per R3.1). Pages: `/dashboard` (all appointments, search, date filter, export, review/vitals/
      complete), `/patients` + `/patients/[accountId]` + `.../self` + `.../dependents/[id]`
      (patient profile, role dropdown, bio+medical edit), `/payment-proofs`, `/payment-qr`, `/live-sheet`.
      `AppointmentCalendar`'s custom grid was not ported — the web dashboard's date filter is a plain
      `<input type="date">` instead, functionally equivalent for this scale.
- [x] **`shared/src/export.ts` (new).** `liveSheetRows()` (+ its vitals-folding helpers) moved out of
      `mobile/src/lib/export.ts` into `shared/` — it was pure business logic with zero RN dependency,
      and the web live-sheet/export needed the exact same row-shaping. Each app keeps its own thin
      `downloadSheet()` (Blob+anchor on web; the existing web/native branches on mobile).
- [x] **Tailwind brand parity.** `web/src/app/globals.css` mirrors `mobile/tailwind.config.js`'s teal
      remap and dark admin-surface palette as native Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens (`brand-*`, `authbg`,
      `admin-*`) so the two apps read as one product.
- [x] **Two build-system gotchas, both from `@vagewell/shared` being a `file:../shared` symlink and
      not a real npm/yarn/pnpm workspace member:**
      1. `web/tsconfig.json` needed the same `baseUrl` + explicit `paths` for `@tanstack/react-query`,
         `@supabase/supabase-js`, `zod` that `mobile/tsconfig.json` already carries (TS resolves a
         symlink's *own* imports from its realpath, which has no `node_modules` of its own) — **this
         is what the original baseUrl question in this session turned out to be about.**
      2. Turbopack (Next 16's default) cannot resolve `@vagewell/shared` at all through the symlink
         (only real workspace packages get auto-transpiled); `transpilePackages` in `next.config.ts`
         didn't fix it either. Fix: `web/package.json` `dev`/`build` scripts pass `--webpack` explicitly.
- [x] **Mobile app made patient-only.** Deleted `AdminNavigator.tsx`, `screens/admin/*` (8 screens),
      `components/admin/*` (`AdminHeader`, `AdminScreen`, `AppointmentCalendar`), the admin-only
      `PaymentReviewModal`/`VitalsModal`, `lib/export.ts`, and the already-dead `ui/TabBar.tsx`.
      `RootNavigator` now shows a **"Staff & admin portal moved" notice + Sign out** for role
      staff/admin instead of mounting `AdminNavigator` (same shared OTP login, so a staff phone can
      still complete sign-in here — this is the dead-end that sends them to `web/` instead). Removed
      the "Admin Portal" entry from `LandingScreen`, the `Admin*` route types, the `ADMIN_*` theme
      constants and `admin-*` Tailwind colors (all now unused), `OtpInput`'s dead `variant="dark"`
      prop, and the now-unused `xlsx` dependency (`npm uninstall`).
- **Needs the user's machine:** `web/.env.local` currently holds placeholder Supabase values (this
  environment has neither Docker/Postgres nor a live project to point at, same constraint as always)
  — fill in the real `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` before deploying.
  Runtime click-through still needed: staff/admin OTP login on `web/`, a patient phone bouncing back
  out of `web/`, and a staff/admin phone bouncing to the new notice screen on `mobile/`.
  **Resolved same day:** real Supabase project connected (`ccvpwfzqgrrhxrmzlkca`) — both `.env` files
  hold the real URL/anon key now, not placeholders.

## Change round — platform expansion: leaf_node, household logins, assignment pipeline, reports (user, 2026-07-29)
User supplied a new end-to-end flowchart and confirmed it **supersedes** the earlier spec in several
places (see the full decision list in the approved plan, `C:\Users\arunb\.claude\plans\modular-meandering-aho.md`).
Net effect: **auth stays phone+OTP for everyone** (patients, staff, admin, and the new leaf_node role)
— no passwords, no email, no Edge Function, contrary to the flowchart's literal "Email/Password" boxes.
Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` all clean (15 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit`
clean + `expo export --platform web` bundles. **`0009_platform_expansion.sql` (or the refreshed
`install_all.sql`) still needs to run in the Supabase SQL Editor** — not executed here, no
Docker/Postgres in this environment, same as every prior migration.

- [x] **New role: `leaf_node`.** `profiles.role` widened to `patient/staff/admin/leaf_node`.
      `is_staff()` redefined to cover all three operational roles (the shared elevated-access
      boundary); `is_admin()` stays the sole full-oversight gate. Onboarding is unchanged in kind:
      a new team member self-registers via phone+OTP (lands as `patient`), an admin promotes them via
      the existing role dropdown — now offering Leaf Node too. Zero new backend surface.
- [x] **Household-linked family logins.** `profiles.primary_account_id` + `family_members.linked_profile_id`
      + a new `in_household()` SQL helper. `handle_new_user()` now auto-claims a matching, unclaimed
      `family_members.contact_phone` row on signup, linking the new account to its primary. `bk_select`/
      `fam_select`/`clin_select`/`report_select` RLS all read through `in_household()` so a primary
      account keeps seeing a linked dependent's own bookings/records. Mobile: dependents show a
      "Has own login" / "Not registered yet" pill (`ProfileScreen`); registering as a family member is
      the same Register screen any patient uses — the linking is entirely server-side.
- [x] **Booking assignment pipeline.** `booking_status` replaces `open/closed/cancelled` with
      `requested → approved → assigned → in_progress → report_uploaded → completed` (or `cancelled` any
      time before `completed`). New `bookings.service_mode` (`clinic`/`home_care`) and `assigned_to`.
      `tg_booking_update_guard()` rewritten as an explicit per-transition permission table (admin-only
      for approve/assign; assigned member or admin for the rest). `bk_select` scopes plain staff/leaf_node
      to `assigned_to = auth.uid()`; admin still sees everything. Web: dashboard's **Approve & Assign**
      modal (`web/src/components/ApproveAssignModal.tsx`) replaces the old single-step "Complete" button;
      new `/my-visits` page (Start Visit → Vitals/Upload Report → Complete) for staff/leaf_node, reusing
      the existing `VitalsModal`. Mobile: patient cancel narrowed to `requested`/`approved` (was `open`);
      `isBookingTerminal()` (new, in `shared/format.ts`) replaces the old `'open'`/`'closed'` checks in
      `DashboardScreen`/`PatientBookingCard`.
- [x] **Pricing model split.** `services.pricing_model` (`per_day` | `flat_advance`). Nutrition & Physio
      Therapy → flat ₹2,000 advance regardless of days; Para-Medical & Mental Wellbeing stay ₹800/day
      (unchanged mechanism). `bookings.total_amount` **stopped being a generated column** — a service's
      pricing model can't be branched on from a same-row generated expression — now computed explicitly
      in `tg_booking_snapshot()` and snapshotted alongside `pricing_model` itself. Mobile
      `AppointmentScreen`/`PaymentScreen` branch their summary display on `pricing_model` (flat total vs
      `days × price`); `num_days`/date fields stay for scheduling even under flat pricing.
- [x] **Report uploads, admin-gated.** New `report_uploads` table + private `medical-reports` storage
      bucket. Staff/leaf_node upload from `/my-visits` (`ReportUploadModal`); an `AFTER INSERT` trigger
      auto-advances the booking to `report_uploaded`. Reports are `reviewed = false` until an admin
      releases them (`review_report()` RPC, new admin `/reports` page) — only then does `report_select`
      RLS let the customer's household see them. Mobile: new **Reports** tab (`ReportsScreen`,
      `AppTabsParamList` gained `ReportsTab`) lists released reports with a tap-to-open signed URL.
- [x] **Hospital Call button** — `HOSPITAL_CONTACT_PHONE` (placeholder, needs the real number) on
      `ServicesScreen`'s header, `Linking.openURL('tel:...')`.
- **Two lint fixes along the way** (same `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` pattern hit twice already
  this project): `web/src/app/reports/page.tsx`'s signed-URL fetch moved from local state + effect to
  a `useQuery`, mirroring the earlier `payment-proofs` fix.
- **Not implemented (flagged, not guessed):** no real payment gateway ("Online Payment API" stays the
  existing UPI-QR + screenshot-proof flow — no credentials exist for a real gateway and none were
  requested); no Employee ID login (auth stays phone+OTP per the confirmed decision above).

## Change round — post-expansion fixes: crash hardening, role landing, admin uploads, live sheet (user, 2026-07-29)
User reported a mobile crash (`Cannot read property 'bg' of undefined`) after the platform-expansion
migration shipped — root cause: any booking/payment row still carrying a pre-migration status value
(e.g. old `open`/`closed`) has no entry in the new `BOOKING_STATUS_META`/`PAYMENT_STATUS_META` maps, so
the direct object-index crashed the whole bundle the moment such a row rendered. Running the refreshed
`install_all.sql` (still outstanding — see prior round) removes the stale data, but the lookup itself
was also fragile by construction, so it's fixed at the source too.

- [x] **Crash-proof status lookups.** New `paymentStatusMeta()`/`bookingStatusMeta()` in `shared/src/format.ts`
      fall back to a plain grey pill (labelled with the raw value) instead of indexing straight into the
      meta record. Replaced every direct `PAYMENT_STATUS_META[...]`/`BOOKING_STATUS_META[...]` call site
      across both apps (`mobile/src/components/feature/PatientBookingCard.tsx`, `mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`,
      `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/payment-proofs/page.tsx`,
      `shared/src/export.ts`) — a stray legacy value now degrades gracefully instead of crashing.
- [x] **Role-aware post-login landing.** `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (the hardcoded redirect target
      after `/verify`) now bounces non-admin ops roles to `/my-visits` once their profile resolves, instead
      of showing staff/leaf_node the full cross-account admin view (whose Approve/Assign actions would
      fail for them under RLS anyway).
- [x] **Admin can upload reports too.** `report_insert` RLS was already `is_staff()` (admin included) —
      only the UI was missing. Added an "Upload Report" action (reusing `ReportUploadModal`) to every
      non-`requested`, non-cancelled booking on the admin dashboard, so upload/scan/prescription capture
      now exists in all three ops panels (staff, admin, leaf_node), not just staff/leaf_node's `/my-visits`.
- [x] **Live sheet — Overall vs Updated view.** `web/src/app/live-sheet/page.tsx` gained a two-way toggle:
      "Overall Sheet" (unchanged, full column set) and a new "Updated Sheet" — a condensed view in the
      exact requested order (Account Holder, Appointment For, Patient Number, Service, Days/Months,
      Appointment Date, Payment Status, Appointment Status; "Date/Time" relabelled "Appointment Date" for
      this view only). CSV export downloads whichever view is active.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (15 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundles clean.
- **Still outstanding, unchanged from the prior round:** `install_all.sql` has not been run against the
  live Supabase project from this environment (no Docker/Postgres here) — the stale-status data causing
  the reported crash won't fully clear until that migration runs.

## Change round — login role picker, date-range filters, reports in health record (user, 2026-07-29)
User clarified an earlier bug report ("just directly entered into the staff panel, doesn't show the
role") via a follow-up question: they want **one login page with a role picker** (Admin/Staff/Leaf
Node), not separate access reads purely off the DB with no visible choice. Phone+OTP itself is
unchanged — the picker is a front door, not a new access-control mechanism (RLS/`RequireStaff` remain
the real gate).

- [x] **Role picker on `web/src/app/login/page.tsx`.** Three buttons (Admin/Staff/Leaf Node, from
      `OPS_ROLES`/`ROLE_LABELS`) select a role that's passed to `/verify` as a query param.
      `web/src/app/verify/page.tsx` now fetches the account's real `profiles.role` right after
      `verifyOtp` and compares it to the pick: a mismatch signs the session back out with an explicit
      "This number is registered as X, not Y" error instead of silently landing somewhere unexpected;
      a match routes straight to `/dashboard` (admin) or `/my-visits` (staff/leaf_node) — no more
      hardcoded `/dashboard` for everyone. `RequireStaff` stays as the enforcement backstop for anyone
      who deep-links in without going through `/login`.
- [x] **Date range filters.** `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`'s single "Filter by date" box replaced
      with From/To fields (inclusive range over `start_date`). `web/src/app/live-sheet/page.tsx` gained
      the same From/To range (it had no date filter before, only search) — it filters the underlying
      bookings before either sheet view is built, so both Overall and Updated sheets respect it.
- [x] **Reports surfaced in the customer Health record.** `mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`'s
      existing "Health record" card (vitals, subject-scoped self/dependent) now also lists that
      subject's released reports underneath the vitals tiles — reports don't carry a subject column, so
      they're matched through their booking's `family_member_id` via `useMyBookings()`. The standalone
      Reports tab is unchanged (still shows every released report across the household in one place);
      this is additive, not a replacement.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (15 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundles clean.
- **Still outstanding, unchanged from prior rounds:** `install_all.sql` not yet run against the live
  Supabase project from this environment.

## Change round — drop standalone customer Reports tab, simplify Services cards (user, 2026-07-29)
Now that released reports show inside the customer's Health record (previous round), the user asked to
drop the separate Reports tab entirely — one place to see reports, not two. Also asked to declutter the
Services screen: no separate price/pricing-model block on each card, and the Nutrition/Physio "advance"
booking should use the exact same Book action as every other service (no separate flow), landing at the
end of the list.

- [x] **Removed the customer `ReportsTab`.** Deleted `mobile/src/screens/ReportsScreen.tsx`; removed
      `ReportsTab` from `AppTabsParamList` (`navigation/types.ts`) and its `Tabs.Screen` registration
      (`navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`). `useMyReports` stays in use (now only from `ProfileScreen`'s
      Health record).
- [x] **Simplified `ServicesScreen` cards.** Removed the separate top-right price/"advance"/"per day"
      block; the price and pricing model now live in the Book button's own label instead (e.g.
      "Book · ₹2,000 advance" / "Book · ₹800/day") — one action per card, not a display block plus a
      separate button. No sort change was needed: `useServices()` already orders by `price_per_day`
      ascending, so the ₹2,000 flat-advance services (Nutrition, Physio) already land after the ₹800
      per-day ones — i.e. at the end of the list, same Book flow as everything else, nothing separate.
      The existing "Add a family member" footer (already at the very end of the list) is unchanged.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — single Book action, hide day count for flat-advance, report dates, hospital number (user, 2026-07-29)
Follow-up correction to the previous Services-screen change: the user actually wanted the per-card Book
button gone entirely, not just relabeled — one Book action for the whole list, at the bottom, right above
Add a family member.

- [x] **One Book button, not four.** `mobile/src/screens/ServicesScreen.tsx` cards are now tap-to-select
      (purple border + checkmark when selected, price/pricing model shown as plain text) with no
      per-card button. A single `PrimaryButton` in the list footer ("Book Appointment") navigates to the
      Appointment screen with whichever service is selected; tapping it with nothing selected shows a
      toast instead of guessing. "Add a family member" sits directly below it, same as before.
- [x] **Flat-advance services skip the day count.** `mobile/src/screens/AppointmentScreen.tsx` hides the
      "Number of days" field when the selected service is `flat_advance` (Nutrition, Physio) — Start date
      alone spans the row. The two `per_day` services (Para-Medical, Mental Wellbeing) keep asking for
      it, unchanged. Submission forces `num_days = 1` for flat-advance regardless of any stale value left
      from a previously selected per-day service, rather than trusting a hidden field's leftover state.
- [x] **Report upload date labelled everywhere it appears.** Admin `/reports` and the customer Health
      record both now read "Uploaded: <date>" instead of a bare timestamp. Also newly surfaced on the
      ops side, using the previously-unused `useReportsForBooking()` hook: `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`
      (staff/leaf_node) and `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (admin) booking cards now show "Report
      uploaded: <date>" once one exists for that booking.
- [x] **Real hospital number.** `HOSPITAL_CONTACT_PHONE` (`shared/src/constants.ts`) changed from the
      `+911234567890` placeholder to `+919342703376`; the customer Services screen's call button already
      dials this constant, no other change needed.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (15 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — wording, upload visibility, confirmed booking flow (user, 2026-07-29)
User confirmed via clarifying questions: (1) `install_all.sql` **has** been run against the live
Supabase project, so the earlier "no uploading reports option" report is not a schema-drift issue — the
button exists but was gated behind a visit stage the user hadn't reached; (2) the Services screen's
select-a-card-then-one-Book-button flow (previous round) is the one to keep, not a book-first-select-
after flow — no structural change made there.

- [x] **Upload Report visible earlier in `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`.** Previously gated behind
      `inFlight` (`in_progress`/`report_uploaded`) alongside Vitals and Complete, so a staff/leaf_node
      member had to tap **Start Visit** before Upload Report ever appeared — the likely cause of "no
      uploading reports option" once schema drift was ruled out. Upload Report now also shows while
      `assigned` (before the visit is started); Vitals and Complete stay gated to `inFlight` since they
      only make sense once a visit is actually underway.
- [x] **Pricing wording.** Flat-advance services now read "Advance ₹2,000 (monthly)" — on the mobile
      Services screen cards, the Appointment screen's service dropdown, and its order summary ("Monthly
      advance payment") — instead of the terser "₹2,000 advance" / "Flat advance payment". Reflects that
      Nutrition/Physio are billed as a recurring monthly amount, not a one-off.
- [x] **Renamed the single Services-screen action** from "Book Appointment" to "Request Appointment" —
      a booking actually lands as `requested` pending admin approval, not confirmed on tap, so the label
      now matches what happens. Same button, same position (bottom of the list), same selected-service
      behavior — wording only.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (15 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — "Request for Booking" quick-contact lead (user, 2026-07-29)
User clarified via a follow-up question: notification of a new request should be **in-app, admin-panel
only** (pull-based, matching the R3.4 precedent of no push/email/SMS alerts) — not a real Twilio SMS to
the admin's phone. New feature, new migration.

- [x] **New `booking_requests` table** (`supabase/migrations/0010_booking_requests.sql`, mirrored into
      `install_all.sql`). Deliberately separate from `bookings` — no service, date, or payment; just
      `account_id` (server-stamped from `auth.uid()` via a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger, same pattern as
      `report_uploads.uploaded_by` — never client-supplied), an optional `note`, and a
      `contacted`/`contacted_by`/`contacted_at` trail. RLS: insert own only; select own row or
      `is_admin()`; a `mark_request_contacted()` RPC (admin-only, mirrors `review_report()`) is the only
      write path for the contacted fields — no direct UPDATE grant.
- [x] **Shared layer**: `BookingRequest`/`BookingRequestWithAccount` types, `qk.bookingRequests`,
      `useBookingRequests(enabled)` (joins `profiles!booking_requests_account_id_fkey` for name/phone),
      `useCreateBookingRequest()`, `useMarkRequestContacted()`.
- [x] **Mobile — `ServicesScreen`**: new "Request for Booking" outline button *above* "Book Appointment"
      (reverted from last round's "Request Appointment" rename now that there are genuinely two distinct
      actions) — fires the insert directly with no service/date picker, toast confirms. "Book
      Appointment" is unchanged: still the full select-a-service-then-book flow.
- [x] **Web — new `/requests` admin page** (`web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx` nav gained "Requests"
      with a red unread-count badge sourced from the same `useBookingRequests` hook; `RequireStaff`-gated
      like every other page, not further admin-restricted since no other admin-only page in this codebase
      is either — nav-hiding + RLS is the established pattern). Lists open requests (name, phone,
      tap-to-call, "Mark contacted") with a collapsed "Contacted" section below.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (16 routes, new `/requests`); `mobile`
  `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0010_booking_requests.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment.

## Change round — booking flow no longer requires pre-selection, profile completion ring, friendlier errors (user, 2026-07-29)
User hit the still-outstanding `0010` migration gap live (screenshot: "Could not find the table
'public.booking_requests'") — confirmed to them again this is a pending-migration issue, not a code bug.
Alongside that, three UX asks:

- [x] **"Book Appointment" no longer requires selecting a service card first.** `mobile/src/screens/ServicesScreen.tsx`'s
      `book()` dropped its "choose a service first" toast guard — it now always navigates to Appointment
      with `serviceId: selected ?? undefined`, and `AppointmentScreen` already falls back to the first
      service when none is passed. Tapping a card still highlights it and pre-fills the picker; it's just
      no longer mandatory. (This reverses the "select first, then Book" behavior confirmed two rounds
      ago — the user's latest instruction explicitly asked for booking to open "without clicking the
      service" first.)
- [x] **Profile completion ring, Naukri-style.** New `ProfileCompletionButton` (inline in `ServicesScreen.tsx`,
      built on `react-native-svg` — already a transitive dependency via `lucide-react-native`, so no new
      package) sits next to the hospital call button in the header: a circular progress ring (grey track,
      brand-teal progress arc) with the percentage as center text, tap-through to the Profile tab.
      Percentage = how many of `full_name`/`age`/`date_of_birth`/`gender` are filled in — the same 4
      fields `ProfileScreen`'s "Your details" edit form covers, so the two never disagree.
- [x] **Booking-request errors no longer leak raw DB text to customers.** `useCreateBookingRequest`'s
      `onError` (`shared/src/mutations.ts`) now always shows a generic "Could not send your request.
      Please try again shortly." instead of `e.message` — a schema-cache error like the one above meant
      nothing to a customer trying to book care. (Every other mutation in this file still surfaces
      `e.message` directly; this one's the exception because its errors are almost always infra-side,
      never something the customer did wrong.)
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean (SVG ring resolved
  fine); `web` `tsc`/`eslint` clean (shares the edited mutation).
- **Still outstanding:** `0010_booking_requests.sql` / refreshed `install_all.sql` not yet run — the
  screenshot's error will keep appearing (now with friendlier wording) until it is.

## Change round — flat-advance services collect months, not days (user, 2026-07-29)
`num_days` was previously hidden entirely for Nutrition/Physio (forced to `1` on submit) — the user
asked for a duration field back, but in **months**, and confirmed the total must stay the flat advance
amount regardless of what's entered (no `months × price` multiplication, same as it was never
`days × price` for these two).

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/AppointmentScreen.tsx`** — the day-count `FormInput` is no longer hidden for
      flat-advance services; it's relabeled "Number of months" (vs "Number of days" for per-day services)
      and feeds the same `form.num_days`/DB column — no schema change, since `bookings.num_days` is just
      an integer and the web live-sheet's "Days/Months" column already anticipated exactly this dual
      meaning. The `effectiveDays = isFlatAdvance ? 1 : days` clamp from two rounds ago is gone; whatever
      the customer enters is now genuinely persisted (previously always saved as `1`, discarding it).
      Total calculation is unchanged — `isFlatAdvance` already ignored `days` when pricing, so unhiding
      the field required no pricing-logic change, only removing the clamp and relabeling. The summary
      panel now reads "Advance payment · N months" with a small "Flat ₹X advance — not multiplied by
      months" note directly underneath, so the flat-vs-multiplied distinction is explicit on screen.
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/PaymentScreen.tsx`** — the summary's "Days" row now reads "Months" for
      flat-advance bookings.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — vc.pdf: missed/reschedule + Checkup history, no-select Services, immutable profile + address (user, 2026-07-30)
Source: `vc.pdf`. New migration (`0011_profile_address.sql`), touches shared types/schemas/mutations, three
mobile screens, and the web patient self-edit form.

- [x] **Missed appointments + Reschedule, Checkup history in Health record.** New `isBookingMissed(status,
      startDate)` (`shared/src/format.ts`) — client-side read on a non-terminal booking whose `start_date`
      has already passed (the pipeline itself has no "missed" state). `mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`
      now splits into an "upcoming" list (not terminal, not missed) and a "Missed" section (red card, "You
      missed it" pill, **Reschedule** button) — the old single "Last appointment" footer is gone entirely.
      Reschedule uses nested tab navigation (`navigation.navigate("ServicesTab", { screen: "Appointment",
      params: { serviceId } })`) — required widening `AppTabsParamList.ServicesTab` from `undefined` to
      `NavigatorScreenParams<ServicesStackParamList> | undefined` (`navigation/types.ts`), plus a new
      `AppTabScreenProps<T>` helper so `DashboardScreen` (previously prop-less) can receive `navigation`.
      Past checkups (completed, cancelled, *or* missed) for the selected subject now live in a new
      "Checkup history" list inside `ProfileScreen`'s Health record card, sorted newest first — this is
      where finished visits are found now, not the Appointments tab.
- [x] **Services screen has no selection step at all.** Removed the tap-to-select card state entirely
      (`ServicesScreen.tsx` — no more `selected`/`CheckCircle2`/highlighted border); it's a pure browse
      list now. "Book Appointment" always navigates to the Appointment screen with no `serviceId`, which
      already defaults to the first service — the Service dropdown there is the only place a service is
      actually chosen. Pricing wording: "Advance ₹2,000 **(monthly package)**" (was "(monthly)").
- [x] **Mobile profile is read-only after registration.** Removed `ProfileScreen`'s entire edit branch
      (`editing` state, `startEdit`/`saveBio`, the bio `FormInput`/`DateField`/`ChoiceChips` form) — "Your
      details" is now always the plain read-only rows, with a note that corrections go through VAgeWell
      staff (i.e. the web admin panel's existing patient-edit form), not a self-service edit here.
      `useUpdateProfile` itself is untouched (still used by the web `MemberEditForm`).
- [x] **New `address` field.** `profiles.address text` (migration `0011`, mirrored into `install_all.sql`
      — `handle_new_user()` now also reads `raw_user_meta_data->>'address'`). Captured on
      `RegisterScreen` (new Address field, sent through OTP signup metadata same as age/gender, backfilled
      post-verify same as the others), shown as a read-only row in `ProfileScreen`, and editable from the
      web admin's `MemberEditForm` (self subject only — dependents have no `address` column) via a new
      optional `address` field on `useUpdateProfile`'s payload.
- [x] **Vitals now show "as of" a date.** `ProfileScreen`'s `VitalsView` reads whichever of the Sugar/Blood
      Group source records is more recent and prints "As of <date>" underneath the tiles — vitals values
      were already the latest-non-null-per-field, but had no date shown at all before.
- **Not changed:** Age is — and was already — optional everywhere it appears (`optionalAge` in
  `shared/src/schemas.ts`, no `required` prop on either Age `FormInput`); found no spot in the code where
  it was actually mandatory, so nothing needed fixing there.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (16 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0011_profile_address.sql` (or refreshed
  `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment. The pricing
  data issue from the previous round (Physio Therapy still reading ₹1,500/day) is a separate, already-
  flagged problem in the same category — still unresolved as of this round.

## Change round — only the most recent missed appointment surfaces on Dashboard (user, 2026-07-30)
User clarified the missed-appointments section from the previous round: don't list *every* missed
booking on the Appointments tab — just the latest one, as a nudge — while the full history (all missed,
completed, cancelled) keeps living in the Profile's Checkup list.

- [x] `mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `missed` array (rendered as a full list) replaced with
      `recentMissed` — a single booking, the one with the latest `start_date` among missed bookings.
      Section heading changed to "Recently missed" to match. `ProfileScreen`'s Checkup history was
      already unfiltered by recency, so it needed no change — it already stores everything.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Still outstanding, unrelated to this round:** the Nutrition/Physio pricing display depends entirely
  on `services.pricing_model`/`price_per_day` in the live database — this has been diagnosed multiple
  times now (see prior rounds) and is not a code issue; the fix SQL has been provided but its effect
  hasn't yet been confirmed via the verification query requested earlier.

## Change round — "missed" now checks time, not just date (user, 2026-07-30)
`isBookingMissed()` previously compared `start_date` alone against today, so a same-day booking was
never "missed" until the calendar day fully rolled over — a 9 AM slot sat as merely "upcoming" all the
way until midnight even though the visit clearly didn't happen.

- [x] **`shared/src/format.ts`** — `isBookingMissed(status, startDate, timeSlot)` now takes the time slot
      too and compares the full scheduled `Date` (start_date + time_slot combined) against `Date.now()`,
      not just the date string against `todayISODate()`. All three call sites
      (`DashboardScreen.tsx` ×2, `ProfileScreen.tsx` ×2) updated to pass `b.time_slot`.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Still outstanding, unrelated to this round:** Nutrition/Physio pricing and the `booking_requests`
  table both still depend on the live database migration, still not confirmed as applied.

## Change round — Reschedule clears the missed booking it replaces (user, 2026-07-30)
Tapping Reschedule opened a fresh Appointment form but left the original missed booking exactly as it
was — so it kept sitting in "Recently missed" even after a new one was booked for the same service.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `reschedule()`** now cancels the missed booking first
      (via `useCancelBooking`) when its `booking_status` is still `requested` or `approved` — the only
      statuses a patient is allowed to self-cancel (server-enforced by `tg_booking_update_guard`).
      A missed booking further along the pipeline (`assigned`, `in_progress`, …) is left alone rather
      than firing a cancel the trigger would reject anyway — that one needs staff to close out. Then
      navigates to the Appointment screen exactly as before.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — stale My Appointments after booking, "Last checkup completed" footer back (user, 2026-07-30)
Two follow-ups: booking a new appointment didn't show up immediately on My Appointments, and the old
"last completed checkup" summary (removed when Checkup history moved into the Profile screen) was wanted
back on the Dashboard too.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/PaymentScreen.tsx`'s booking insert never invalidated any query cache** — it
      writes straight via `supabase.from("bookings").insert(...)` (not a shared mutation hook, since
      server-authored fields like `total_amount` only exist after the trigger runs), so `useMyBookings()`
      kept serving up to 60s of stale data (its configured `staleTime`) after a fresh booking, a payment
      proof upload, or a reschedule. Added `qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: qk.bookings("mine") })` right
      after both the booking insert and the payment-proof update succeed.
- [x] **"Last checkup completed" footer restored on `DashboardScreen`.** A new `lastCompleted` (most
      recent `booking_status === 'completed'`, independent of the "Recently missed" section — both can
      show at once) renders via a read-only `LastCompletedCheckup` card in the `FlatList`'s footer. This
      doesn't duplicate the Profile's full Checkup history — it's just an at-a-glance pointer to the
      latest one, restoring what the pre-vc.pdf `LastAppointment` component used to do.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — belt-and-braces on stale data + missed dismissal (user, 2026-07-30)
User reported the previous round's fixes still weren't reliable enough — asked to "change it clearly."
Rather than re-diagnose the same cache-timing question, made both behaviors deterministic instead of
depending on invalidation timing or a server permission outcome.

- [x] **`DashboardScreen` now refetches on every focus**, via `useFocusEffect` (`@react-navigation/native`)
      calling `refetch()` from `useMyBookings()`. Booking, uploading a payment proof, and rescheduling all
      happen on a *different* screen/tab, so relying solely on `invalidateQueries` fired from elsewhere
      left a window where this tab wouldn't notice. Refetching on focus means the tab is always correct
      the moment it's actually looked at, regardless of what happened on another screen or when.
- [x] **"Recently missed" now clears unconditionally the instant Reschedule is tapped** — a new locally-
      persisted dismissed-IDs set (`AsyncStorage`, key `vagewell.dismissedMissedBookingIds`) is checked
      alongside the existing cancel attempt, not instead of it. Previously, clearing the banner depended
      on the server cancel actually succeeding (only true for `requested`/`approved` bookings) — a missed
      booking already `assigned` or further along would cancel-attempt silently and then keep reappearing
      forever, since nothing else ever removed it from view. Now the nudge disappears on this device the
      moment the user acts on it, independent of whatever state the underlying booking is actually left
      in server-side (staff still see and handle the real row via the web portal as before).
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — dismiss on actual booking, not on tapping Reschedule (user, 2026-07-30)
User corrected the previous round: dismissing "Recently missed" the moment Reschedule is *tapped* was
too early — the customer might open the form and back out without booking anything, and the old missed
booking would incorrectly vanish forever. It should only clear once the replacement is actually booked.

- [x] **Dismissal logic moved from `DashboardScreen` to `PaymentScreen`.** `reschedule()` on the Dashboard
      now only navigates (`{ serviceId, rescheduleOf: b.id }` — new `rescheduleOf` param on
      `ServicesStackParamList.Appointment`); it no longer cancels or dismisses anything itself.
      `AppointmentScreen` threads `route.params.rescheduleOf` into a new `BookingDraft.reschedule_of`
      field. `PaymentScreen.confirm()` — only once its own booking insert has actually succeeded — cancels
      the old booking (best-effort; a no-op if it's already past requested/approved) and calls the new
      `dismissMissedBooking()` helper.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/lib/dismissedMissed.ts`** — extracted the `AsyncStorage`-backed dismissed-IDs
      logic (previously inline in `DashboardScreen`) into shared `loadDismissedMissedIds()` /
      `dismissMissedBooking()` functions, since both `DashboardScreen` (reads, to filter) and
      `PaymentScreen` (writes, on success) need it now.
- [x] **`DashboardScreen`'s `useFocusEffect` also reloads dismissed IDs**, not just refetches bookings —
      the actual dismissal now happens on a different screen (Payment), so this tab needs to notice it
      whenever it's returned to.
- Clarified for the user, not a code change: the **Cancel** button already exists on every booking card
  (`PatientBookingCard.tsx`) — it only shows while `booking_status` is `requested` or `approved`, the
  same server-enforced window a patient can act in. Once staff assigns/starts a visit, only staff can
  cancel it from the web portal.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — surface Clinic Visit / Home Care to the customer (user, 2026-07-30)
User asked how a customer is supposed to know which mode (Clinic Visit vs Home Care) admin picked when
approving their booking — `bookings.service_mode` existed server-side (set on approval) but nothing in
the mobile app ever displayed it back to the patient.

- [x] **New `ServiceModeBadge`** (small indigo pill, `Building2`/`Home` icon + `SERVICE_MODE_LABELS`
      text) shown once `booking.service_mode` is set — i.e. from `approved` onward, since that's the
      admin action that decides it. Wired into `mobile/src/components/feature/PatientBookingCard.tsx`
      (every active booking) and `mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `MissedAppointment` /
      `LastCompletedCheckup` summary cards, so it's visible everywhere a booking shows up. While a
      booking is still `requested` (mode not decided yet), `PatientBookingCard` shows a small "Clinic or
      home visit — decided once approved" hint instead, so the absence doesn't read as a bug.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — customer picks Clinic Visit or Home Care at booking time (user, 2026-07-30)
Reframes the previous round's badge: instead of just *displaying* whatever admin later decides, the
customer now picks the visit type themselves on the Appointment screen, same as any other booking field
— admin's job becomes assigning a matching staff/leaf_node member, not choosing the mode.

- [x] **DB (migration `0012_customer_chosen_service_mode.sql`, mirrored into `install_all.sql`).**
      `tg_booking_snapshot()` (the `BEFORE INSERT` trigger) previously hard-set `new.service_mode := null`
      unconditionally — now it validates the client-supplied value (`raise exception 'choose a visit type
      (clinic or home care)'` if missing/invalid) and leaves it as given. Also had to widen the column-
      level `grant insert (...)` on `bookings` to include `service_mode` — patients literally could not
      write that column before, regardless of RLS, since the grant list never named it.
- [x] **Shared**: `appointmentSchema` (`shared/src/schemas.ts`) gained a required `service_mode` enum
      field.
- [x] **Mobile `AppointmentScreen.tsx`**: new "Visit type" `ChoiceChips` (Clinic Visit / Home Care,
      default Clinic) between "Care for" and the date/duration row; threaded through `BookingDraft`
      (`navigation/types.ts` gained `service_mode: ServiceMode`) into `PaymentScreen`, whose insert
      payload now includes it — the booking summary there also gained a "Visit type" row so the customer
      sees their own choice before confirming.
- [x] **Web `ApproveAssignModal.tsx` no longer lets admin pick the mode** — it reads `booking.service_mode`
      (now already set by the customer) and shows it as a read-only "(chosen by customer)" line, filtering
      assignable staff/leaf_node candidates off that value directly. The old mode dropdown only reappears
      as a fallback for a booking created *before* this change, where `service_mode` is still `null` —
      `useAssignBooking`'s existing optional `serviceMode` param is only sent in that legacy case, so a
      customer's real choice is never silently overwritten.
- [x] **Pricing wording** — "Advance ₹2,000 (monthly package)" → "Advance ₹2,000 **(Monthly Followup)**"
      on `ServicesScreen.tsx`'s cards and `AppointmentScreen.tsx`'s service dropdown, matching the exact
      phrase requested. The summary panel's "not multiplied by months" note was already accurate and
      unchanged.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (16 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0012_customer_chosen_service_mode.sql`
  (or refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment —
  until it does, a customer picking a visit type will hit the new "choose a visit type" server error on
  submit, since the column-level insert grant doesn't exist there yet either.

## Bugfix — install_all.sql aborted partway through on every re-run (user, 2026-07-30)
**Root cause of essentially every "nothing changed" / stale-pricing / missing-table report across this
entire project.** User finally pasted the actual SQL Editor error: `ERROR: 42501: illegal
booking_status transition` from `tg_booking_update_guard()`, thrown *while running the migration script
itself* — not from the app.

The script's legacy-data backfill (`update bookings set booking_status = 'requested' where
booking_status = 'open'`, the 0009-era `open`/`closed` → new-pipeline conversion) is an `UPDATE` on
`public.bookings`. The very first time the script ran, `tg_bookings_before_update` didn't exist yet, so
this succeeded fine. But `install_all.sql` is explicitly meant to be re-run repeatedly ("idempotent, safe
to re-run") — and on every run *after* the first, that trigger already exists, fires on this UPDATE, and
`tg_booking_update_guard()` has no rule permitting a bare `'open'` → `'requested'` transition (only the
seven pipeline states know each other), so it hits the catch-all `raise exception 'illegal
booking_status transition'` and the **entire script aborts right there** — meaning every single change
positioned after it in the file (the full 0009–0012 feature set, the services reseed, the
`booking_requests` table, all of it) silently never ran, on every attempt. This is exactly consistent
with everything reported over the last several rounds: stale Physio Therapy pricing (the reseed is near
the end of the script), the missing `booking_requests` table (created even later), etc. — all downstream
of the script dying at this one line, every time.

- [x] **Fixed in both `supabase/migrations/0009_platform_expansion.sql` and `supabase/install_all.sql`.**
      Two changes: (1) the status `CHECK` constraint is now widened *before* the legacy-value backfill
      runs (previously backwards — on a truly fresh pre-0009 table the old constraint would have rejected
      `'requested'`/`'completed'` outright, a second latent bug); (2) the backfill is now wrapped in a
      trigger-existence check that disables `tg_bookings_before_update` immediately before the two
      `UPDATE`s and re-enables it immediately after — using `pg_trigger` existence checks (not a bare
      `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER`, which errors if the trigger doesn't exist yet on a genuinely
      fresh install) so it's correct on both a first-ever run and every subsequent re-run.
- **Action for the user:** re-run the now-fixed `install_all.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor — this
  should finally get all the way through and actually create `booking_requests`, fix the services
  pricing, and apply everything else that's been silently skipped every time before.

## Bugfix #2 — the trigger-guard fix above had its own chicken-and-egg bug (user, 2026-07-30)
User re-ran the fixed script and hit a *new* error: `23514: check constraint
"bookings_booking_status_check" of relation "bookings" is violated by some row`. The previous fix
widened the constraint before the legacy-value backfill specifically to avoid the *old* constraint
rejecting the *new* values — but that meant the constraint-widening `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT`
itself now validated all existing rows against the new 7-value set immediately, and any row still
sitting on `'open'`/`'closed'` (which the backfill hadn't run yet at that point) violated it outright.
Textbook chicken-and-egg: neither ordering works with a plain `ADD CONSTRAINT`.

- [x] **Fixed in both files** by adding the constraint as `not valid` first — enforced for every write
  from that point forward, but skips the initial full-table validation scan of existing rows — then
  running the trigger-guarded backfill exactly as before, then `alter table ... validate constraint
  bookings_booking_status_check` at the end to confirm the whole table is now clean. This is the
  standard Postgres pattern for widening a constraint across a data migration and has no ordering
  conflict either way.
- **Action for the user:** re-run `install_all.sql` again — this should now finally complete end to end.

## Change round — Reschedule clears "Recently missed" on tap, not on booking completion (user, 2026-07-30)
User reversed the earlier "only dismiss once the replacement is actually booked" decision: tapping
Reschedule should empty the "Recently missed" space immediately.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `reschedule()`** now calls `dismissMissedBooking()`
      (and updates local state) the moment Reschedule is tapped, then navigates — same as the very first
      version of this feature, before the mid-conversation correction. `PaymentScreen.tsx`'s own dismiss
      call on successful booking is left in place too (idempotent no-op at that point) since the actual
      server-side cancel of the old booking still only happens once a replacement is genuinely created —
      only the local "hide the nudge" behavior moved earlier.
- **Trade-off, stated plainly:** if the customer taps Reschedule and then backs out of the Appointment
  form without completing a new booking, the missed one will no longer reappear in "Recently missed" on
  this device (though it's untouched server-side, and still visible in the Profile's Checkup history).
  This is the explicit trade-off of the current request; flag if that turns out to be unwanted.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — Reschedule now actually cancels the missed booking server-side (user, 2026-07-30)
User reported the previous round's fix still didn't work: rescheduled and booked a replacement, but the
original missed booking kept showing in "Recently missed." The local-only `AsyncStorage` dismiss depends
on that exact device still having that exact persisted flag on every subsequent load — fragile across
reloads, and impossible to verify from this environment. Made it work unconditionally by actually
cancelling the old booking on the server the moment Reschedule is tapped, not waiting on anything else.

- [x] **`DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `reschedule()`** now calls `useCancelBooking().mutate(b.id)` immediately
      when the booking is still `requested`/`approved` (the only statuses a patient can self-cancel,
      server-enforced) — this permanently removes it from every future "missed" computation on every
      device, since a `cancelled` booking is terminal. The local dismiss (`dismissMissedBooking`) still
      also fires as a belt-and-braces for a missed booking already past that stage (`assigned`+), which a
      patient can't cancel themselves — that one is left for staff to close out via the web portal, but at
      least stops nagging this device.
- [x] **Removed the now-dead `reschedule_of`/`rescheduleOf` threading entirely** — since the cancel no
      longer waits for a replacement booking to exist, there's nothing left for `PaymentScreen` to do with
      it. Removed from `BookingDraft` (`navigation/types.ts`), `ServicesStackParamList.Appointment`'s
      params, `AppointmentScreen`'s draft construction, and `PaymentScreen`'s insert handler (which no
      longer imports `dismissMissedBooking` at all).
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Bugfix — new bookings could be "missed" the instant they're created (user, 2026-07-30)
Good news buried in the bug report: the previous round's fix actually worked — the original missed
Nutrition booking (Maheshwari S, 06:00 AM) genuinely disappeared from "Recently missed" after Reschedule
was tapped and a replacement booked. But a **different** Nutrition booking (a dependent, 07:00 AM, same
date) immediately took its place as "missed" — a brand-new booking, showing up already missed.

Root cause: `AppointmentScreen`'s form defaults to `start_date: todayISODate()` and
`time_slot: SLOTS[0].value` (the earliest slot, 06:00). The date picker (`DateField`) only blocks
picking a date *before* today — it says nothing about the time slot. If the customer submits without
changing the date/time away from those defaults (very easy to do on a Reschedule, where the flow already
feels "done" once you've picked a service), and the current time of day is already past whatever slot is
selected, the booking is created already in the past — `isBookingMissed()` correctly flags it as missed
the moment it exists, since it genuinely is.

- [x] **`AppointmentScreen.tsx`'s `submit()`** now checks, when `start_date` equals today, whether the
      chosen `time_slot` is still later than the current clock time — if not, blocks submission with
      "That time has already passed today — pick a later time or a future date" (same
      `errors`/`FormInput`-style validation pattern already used for the other fields), instead of
      silently creating an already-missed booking.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — dismiss "Recently missed" without rescheduling (user, 2026-07-30)
The prior screenshot confirmed the cancel-on-reschedule fix genuinely worked (a *different* stale test
booking took the missed one's place, unrelated). New ask: a way to clear the "Recently missed" nudge
when the customer simply doesn't want to reschedule that visit at all — not every missed booking should
force a reschedule.

- [x] **New "✕" button on `MissedAppointment`** (`DashboardScreen.tsx`), top-right of the card, next to
      the total. Calls a new `dismissOnly(b)` — local dismiss only (`dismissMissedBooking` +
      `dismissedMissed` state), no server-side cancel. The underlying booking is left exactly as it is;
      staff still see and can act on the real row via the web portal. This is deliberately different from
      `reschedule()`, which does attempt an actual cancel — dismissing isn't the same as saying "this
      never happened," just "stop showing me this."
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — self-service registration on the web staff portal (user, 2026-07-31)
User asked how a brand-new staff/leaf_node hire is supposed to get into the web portal, since `/login`
was login-only (`shouldCreateUser: false`) — there was no way in without already having an account.
Given a choice between just pointing new hires at the mobile app to register vs. letting a brand-new
number register directly on the web portal, the user chose the latter.

- [x] **New `web/src/app/register/page.tsx`.** Phone+OTP self-registration mirroring the mobile app's
      `RegisterScreen` two-step (details → OTP) pattern, but trimmed to just Full Name + Mobile Number —
      the other patient-only fields (age/gender/how_heard/wellness_note) don't apply to an ops account.
      `signInWithOtp({ shouldCreateUser: true, data: { full_name } })` lets a genuinely new number create
      an account here (unlike `/login`'s `shouldCreateUser: false`); `handle_new_user()` is unchanged and
      unaware of which app called it, so the new profile lands exactly like any mobile signup.
- [x] **Self-registered accounts always land as plain `role='patient'`, never an elevated role** —
      deliberately preserving the project's existing "no self-service elevated access" principle (staff/
      leaf_node/admin has always required an admin promotion via the role dropdown, never a self-pick).
      After OTP verification the page signs the session back out immediately (a patient-role session has
      nothing to do in this portal, and `RequireStaff` would bounce it on the next load anyway) and shows
      a "Account created — ask an admin to grant you access" message instead of attempting any redirect.
- [x] **`web/src/app/login/page.tsx`** gained a "New to VAgeWell? Register" link to the new page, mirroring
      the mobile Login screen's "New to VAgeWell? Create an account" link to Register.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, new `/register`). No DB
  migration — reuses `handle_new_user()` and the existing role-promotion flow as-is.

## Change round — self-registration now grants the picked role immediately (user, 2026-07-31)
User rejected the "lands as patient, needs admin approval" design from the previous round: the Register
page should show the same role picker as `/login` and grant that role the moment OTP verifies — no
approval step. Asked directly which of three trade-offs to accept (immediate self-assign of Staff/Leaf
Node only, immediate self-assign of all three including Admin, or picker-as-request-only keeping the
approval step); user explicitly chose **immediate self-assign, all three roles including Admin**, having
been told plainly that this means anyone who can complete an OTP verification can make themselves an
admin.

- [x] **New migration `0013_self_select_role.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "Combines migrations 0001–0013"). `handle_new_user()` now reads `requested_role` from the signup's
      `raw_user_meta_data` — if it's one of `staff`/`admin`/`leaf_node` the new profile is created with
      that role directly; anything else (including absent, the mobile Register screen's case) still
      defaults to `patient`, unchanged from before. This only ever runs on account **creation** — the
      trigger fires once per new `auth.users` row, so an already-existing account has no way to call this
      path again later to escalate itself; only a fresh signup can land with an elevated role this way.
- [x] **`web/src/app/register/page.tsx`** gained the same "Registering as" Staff/Admin/Leaf Node picker
      as `/login` (`OPS_ROLES`/`ROLE_LABELS`), sends the pick as `requested_role` in the signup metadata,
      and — since the account now already has the right role the instant OTP verifies — routes straight
      into the portal (`/dashboard` for Admin, `/my-visits` for Staff/Leaf Node) instead of signing out
      to a "wait for approval" screen.
- **Accepted, stated risk (not a bug):** `requested_role` is read from client-supplied signup metadata,
  so this isn't confined to the web UI's picker — any brand-new signup that includes
  `requested_role: 'admin'` in its metadata lands as admin immediately, whether it comes through this
  page, a hand-crafted call to the Supabase Auth API, or in principle the mobile app's own signup call
  (its `RegisterScreen` never sends this field today, so ordinary patient signups are unaffected in
  practice, but nothing at the database layer distinguishes "came from the web register page" from any
  other caller). This is the direct, explicit consequence of the "immediate, all three roles" choice
  above, not an oversight — flagging it here in case a future hardening pass is wanted (e.g. requiring an
  invite code, or restricting self-assignable roles to Staff/Leaf Node only and keeping Admin
  promotion-only).
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). **Needs the user's machine,
  same as every prior migration:** `0013_self_select_role.sql` (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has
  not run against the live Supabase project from this environment — until it does, a new signup's
  `requested_role` is silently ignored and every new account still lands as `patient`, same as before.

## Bugfix — Register silently trusted the picked role instead of confirming it (user, 2026-07-31)
User tried registering `+919000000002` as Staff and landed on `/verify`'s "registered as Patient, not
Staff" mismatch screen — confusing, since that error message belongs to the *Login* flow, not Register.
Root cause: `web/src/app/register/page.tsx`'s `verify()` never actually checked what role the account
landed with — it just trusted the client-side `role` state the user had picked and redirected blindly
into `/dashboard` or `/my-visits`, where `RequireStaff` would then bounce a mismatched account back to
`/login` with no explanation of why. Two independent things can cause a mismatch, and this fix surfaces
either one directly on the Register page instead of failing silently three steps later:
1. **`0013_self_select_role.sql` genuinely hasn't run yet** against this Supabase project — the *only*
   outstanding migration action, unchanged from the previous round. `handle_new_user()` is still the
   pre-0013 version there, ignores `requested_role` entirely, and every new signup still lands `patient`.
2. **The phone number already had an account.** `handle_new_user()` only ever fires once, on the very
   first `auth.users` insert for that number — this is inherent to the design (see 0013's own comment:
   "only a fresh signup can set a role this way"). `+919000000002` is one of `config.toml`'s test-OTP
   numbers and had very likely already signed up during earlier testing in this project, so re-registering
   it can never change its role no matter what's picked or whether 0013 has run.
- [x] **`verify()` now re-fetches `profiles.role` after `verifyOtp` and compares it to the picked role**
  (same check `/verify`'s Login flow already does) before redirecting anywhere. A match proceeds exactly
  as before. A mismatch signs the session back out and shows a clear, actionable message on the Register
  page itself: *"This number already has an account (registered as X). Role selection only applies the
  first time a number signs up — ask an admin to change an existing account's role, or register with a
  different number."* — instead of quietly landing on `/verify`'s unrelated error copy.
- [x] **Stopped overwriting `full_name` on a mismatch.** The pre-fix code ran its `full_name` backfill
  unconditionally; moved it to only run once a role match confirms this really is a fresh registration —
  a failed attempt on someone else's existing number must not silently rename their account.
- **For the user, right now:** to test the feature itself, either (a) confirm `install_all.sql` /
  `0013_self_select_role.sql` has actually been run in the Supabase SQL Editor, **and** (b) use a phone
  number that has genuinely never signed up before (not `9000000002`/`9000000003`/etc. if they were used
  in earlier testing rounds) — check with
  `select id, phone, role, created_at from profiles where phone = '+91XXXXXXXXXX';` in the SQL Editor
  first. To fix an already-existing test account directly: `update profiles set role = 'staff' where
  phone = '+919000000002';` (swap the role/number as needed) — a manual promotion, same mechanism the
  admin role dropdown itself performs.

## Bugfix — portal hung on an infinite "Loading…" after OTP with no error shown (user, 2026-07-31)
After promoting `+919000000002`/`+919000000003` via the SQL above and logging in through `/login`, the
portal got stuck on a blank "Loading…" screen indefinitely — no error, no redirect, nothing. `web/.env.local`
confirmed the app targets the real hosted project (`ccvpwfzqgrrhxrmzlkca.supabase.co`), so this wasn't a
local-vs-hosted mismatch.

Root cause, found by reading `AuthProvider.loadProfile()`: `supabase.from("profiles").select("*")...
.maybeSingle()` **does not throw on a database-level error** — the Supabase JS client resolves it as
`{ data: null, error }` instead. The old code only destructured `data`, never checked `error`, so any
failed profile fetch (permission hiccup, transient network blip, anything) looked byte-for-byte identical
to one still in flight: `profile` just stayed `null` forever. `RequireStaff`'s render guard
(`loading || !user || !profileResolved || !isOpsRole(role)`) can't tell "still loading" apart from
"failed and never will," so it rendered the same spinner in both cases, forever, with the actual failure
reason discarded and never shown anywhere — the exact symptom reported, and impossible to diagnose further
from outside the browser's own DevTools.

- [x] **`AuthProvider.tsx`**: `loadProfile()` now checks the returned `error` (and treats a genuinely
      empty result — `data` null with no error — as its own error too, since `handle_new_user()` should
      always have created a row) and stores it in new state `profileError`, exposed on the auth context.
      Wrapped in try/catch as well, so a thrown network exception is captured the same way instead of
      propagating.
- [x] **`RequireStaff.tsx`** now renders an explicit error card — the message plus **Try again**
      (`refreshProfile()`) and **Sign out** buttons — the moment `profileError` is set and nothing is still
      in flight, instead of falling through to the generic spinner. Whatever is actually wrong is now
      visible on screen instead of requiring a DevTools Network-tab investigation.
- **Not diagnosed further here** (no way to inspect the user's live browser/network from this
  environment) — this fix turns the next occurrence into a readable error message instead of a silent
  hang, which is what's needed to actually identify the underlying cause (paused project, RLS drift,
  transient network issue, or something else) next time it happens.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes).

## Bugfix — the actual cause: a race between verifyOtp() and a follow-up getUser() call (user, 2026-07-31)
The error-surfacing fix above did its job — it turned the silent hang into a readable message: Register,
re-tested against `+919000000002`, now showed **"Could not confirm your account's role. Please try
again."** instead of hanging. That pointed straight at the real bug: `actualRole` was coming back `null`,
meaning the `profiles` select matched **zero rows** — for an account that unquestionably exists.

Root cause: `register/page.tsx`'s `verify()` (and `verify/page.tsx`'s identical pattern) called
`supabase.auth.verifyOtp(...)`, threw away its response, then made a **separate** `supabase.auth.getUser()`
call right after to get the just-verified user. That second call is racy — if it executes before the new
session has fully settled on the client, it can return no user, so the follow-up
`.eq("id", user?.id ?? "")` profile lookup runs with an empty string and matches nothing. `verifyOtp()`
already returns the authenticated user directly in its own response (`data.user`) — there was never a
reason to ask again.

- [x] **`web/src/app/register/page.tsx`** and **`web/src/app/verify/page.tsx`**: both now read
      `verifyData.user` from `verifyOtp()`'s own return value instead of a follow-up `getUser()` call —
      removes the race entirely, one fewer network round-trip too.
- [x] **Register's error messages sharpened further**: the profile-select's `error` is now checked
      explicitly (`Could not confirm your account: <db error>`) rather than only handling "zero rows";
      a genuinely missing user object after a successful verify gets its own explicit message too,
      instead of silently coercing to `""` and producing the same generic "could not confirm" text
      regardless of which of the (now three) distinct failure modes actually occurred.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes).

## Bugfix — Staff / Leaf Nodes admin pages had no way to promote anyone (user, 2026-07-31)
User asked how to promote `9000000002`/`9000000003` from the admin UI instead of hand-running SQL each
time, and reported no add/promote option existed on the `/staff` or `/leaf-nodes` pages. Confirmed by
reading `web/src/components/OpsMemberList.tsx` (shared by both pages): its list is filtered to
`p.role === role` **unconditionally** — i.e. it only ever shows people who *already* hold that role — and
its empty state read "Promote a registered account below to see it here," which was simply untrue: there
was no such control anywhere on the page. The only real promote control in the whole app lives on
`/patients/[accountId]`'s Role dropdown, reachable only by finding the account under **Patients** first
(which itself only lists `role === 'patient'` accounts) — nothing on `/staff`/`/leaf-nodes` said so.

- [x] **`OpsMemberList.tsx`**: typing into the search box now widens the pool from "current holders of
      this role" to **every account**, so an existing patient (or any other role) can be found by name or
      phone directly on the Staff/Leaf Nodes page and promoted with the same inline role dropdown that was
      already there for existing members — no query, and the list still narrows to just that role, same as
      before. Placeholder text and both empty-state variants (no query vs. no match) rewritten to describe
      what's actually possible, instead of pointing at a nonexistent control.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No DB change — this only
  changes what the existing `useAllProfiles`/`useSetUserRole` data is filtered to show.

## Data fix — baked the two test-account role promotions into `install_all.sql` (user, 2026-07-31)
`+919000000002` then started showing "No profile record was found for this account" — a step further
broken than the earlier "registered as Patient" mismatch, meaning its `profiles` row was gone entirely
(most likely deleted directly at some point without also deleting the `auth.users` row, or an earlier
manual `update ... where phone = '+91...'` silently matched nothing — `auth.users.phone` is stored
**without** the leading `+`, so a filter that includes it never matches). User asked for the fix to live
in `install_all.sql` itself rather than a one-off snippet, so re-running the script they already run
repeatedly takes care of it.

- [x] **`supabase/install_all.sql`**, right after the existing commented-out founding-admin promotion
      block: an active (not commented) `insert ... on conflict do update` for both test numbers —
      `9000000002 → staff`, `9000000003 → leaf_node`. `insert ... on conflict` rather than a plain
      `update` specifically so it repairs the account even when its `profiles` row is missing outright,
      not just when it exists with the wrong role; `replace(phone, '+', '')` matches regardless of the
      `+` prefix. Idempotent — safe on every re-run, matching this file's existing convention (see the
      founding-admin block right above it, same pattern). Meant to be deleted once these two numbers are
      no longer needed for testing.
- **Action for the user:** re-run `install_all.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor; both accounts should read
  the correct role afterward regardless of whatever broken state they were left in.

## Change round — "View Report" action on My Visits (user, 2026-07-31)
Staff/leaf_node's `/my-visits` card showed "Report uploaded: <date>" once a report existed for that
booking, but gave no way to actually open it — the only place that could was the admin's `/reports` page.

- [x] **`web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`**: `VisitCard` gained a **View Report** action (shown whenever
      `latestReport` exists, alongside Vitals/Upload Report/Complete) that creates a signed URL for the
      report's `storage_path` (`MEDICAL_REPORT_BUCKET`, `SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS` — the exact same call the
      admin `/reports` page already uses) and opens it in a new tab. Fetched on click, not eagerly per
      card, to avoid a storage API call for every visible visit regardless of whether anyone looks.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes).

## Change round — full report history for every ops role, with patient name & date (user, 2026-07-31)
User's follow-up: the admin `/reports` page only ever showed reports still awaiting review (once
released, they vanished — no audit trail), it was admin-only in the nav (staff/leaf_node had no access at
all), and there was no reliable "who is this for" — clarified via a follow-up question that **all three
ops roles** need to see the full report history (with patient name and upload date), while the mobile
app's patient-facing view stays exactly as-is (reviewed reports only, unchanged).

The real blocker to doing this simply: `report_select` RLS already grants any `is_staff()` caller
(staff/leaf_node/admin) every report regardless of whose booking it's on, but `bk_select` scopes plain
staff/leaf_node to only their **own assigned** bookings. So a client-side join against `bookings` to
resolve "which patient/service is this report for" would silently come up empty for any report outside
that staff member's own assigned scope — visible, but unlabeled. Fixed at the source: snapshot the name
onto the report row itself at upload time, the same pattern already used everywhere else in this schema
(`bookings.service_name`/`price_per_day`, etc.).

- [x] **New migration `0014_report_uploads_snapshot.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header
      bumped to "0001–0014"): `report_uploads` gains `patient_name`/`service_name` columns, populated by
      `tg_report_uploaded_stamp()` (the existing `BEFORE INSERT` trigger, now also looking up the parent
      booking's service and subject — family member or account — at write time) plus a repair-path
      backfill for rows that predate this column.
- [x] **`shared/src/types.ts`**: `ReportUpload` gains the two new fields. **`shared/src/hooks.ts`**: new
      `useAllReports(enabled)` — every report, reviewed or not, no bookings join needed at all now.
      **`shared/src/mutations.ts`**: `useUploadReport`/`useReviewReport` invalidate the new `qk.reportsAll`
      key too, alongside what they already invalidated.
- [x] **`web/src/app/reports/page.tsx`** rewritten: title "Reports" (was "Reports awaiting review"), lists
      *everything* via `useAllReports`, each card shows `service_name · patient_name` directly (no join,
      no lookup-miss risk), a search box (name or service), and a Released/Awaiting-review pill. **View**
      (signed URL, opens in a new tab) is available to everyone; **Release** only renders for
      `role === 'admin'` on an unreleased row — matches what `review_report()` already enforces
      server-side, just not exposed as an action to roles that would only get a 403 from it.
- [x] **`web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx`**: added "Reports" to `OPS_NAV`, so staff/leaf_node can reach
      the page at all — it was in `ADMIN_NAV` only before, with no way in for the other two roles even
      though RLS always permitted it.
- **Not touched, by explicit instruction:** the mobile app's report visibility (`useMyReports`, the
  patient Health record) — patients still only ever see `reviewed = true` rows for their own household,
  unchanged; this round is entirely about the staff-side view.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean (2823 modules — confirms the shared `ReportUpload` type
  change didn't break the mobile side, which also consumes it).
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0014_report_uploads_snapshot.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment — until
  it does, `patient_name`/`service_name` will read `null` on both new and existing report rows.

## Change round — Reports as a real table, filename capture, popup-blocker fix (user, 2026-07-31)
Follow-up: the card layout wasn't the tabular columns asked for (date / patient name / report name), and
"clicking did nothing" on the previous round's My Visits **View Report** button — root-caused as a classic
popup-blocker trap: that button's `onClick` called `window.open()` **after an `await`** (fetching the
signed URL first), and by the time the promise resolved, the browser no longer considers it a direct user
gesture — most browsers silently swallow the call, no error, no console warning, just nothing happening.

- [x] **New migration `0015_report_file_name.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0015"): `report_uploads.file_name` — the original uploaded filename was never captured before
      (`storage_path` is a generated `<booking_id>/<uploaded_by>/<timestamp>.<ext>`, not the source name),
      so there was nothing readable to show as "which file is this" beyond the report type category.
      `ReportUploadModal.tsx` now passes `file.name` through `useUploadReport`'s new `fileName` param into
      the insert.
- [x] **`web/src/app/reports/page.tsx` rewritten as an actual `<table>`**: Uploaded (date) / Patient
      (name + service) / Report (file name + type + note) / Status / Actions columns, sorted newest first,
      same search box and View/Release actions as before.
- [x] **Popup-blocker fix, both pages**: replaced every "click handler awaits a signed URL, then
      `window.open()`" pattern with prefetching signed URLs up front (`useQuery`, keyed off the visible
      report(s)) and rendering a real `<a href target="_blank">` once the URL resolves — a genuine link
      click is never blocked, regardless of the async fetch that produced its `href`. Fixed in both
      `web/src/app/reports/page.tsx` (already used this pattern for its list, unaffected) and
      `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`'s `VisitCard` (the actual bug — its View Report button used the
      broken pattern), which also now shows the report's filename alongside its upload date.
- **Confirmed, not changed:** who can upload/release was already correctly locked down — `report_uploads`
  has no `update` grant at all (only the admin-only `review_report()` RPC can touch `reviewed`/`reviewed_by`/
  `reviewed_at`, via `security definer`), and `report_insert` RLS already requires `is_staff()`. A patient
  has no reachable path to upload or edit a report today; nothing needed fixing there.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Needs the user's machine:** `0015_report_file_name.sql` (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`), on top of
  the still-outstanding `0014` from the previous round — until both run, the Report column falls back to
  just the report-type label (no filename) and patient/service names stay blank.

## Follow-up — confirmed the table rewrite is live; mobile Health record shows filenames too (user, 2026-07-31)
User repeated the same "no changes happen" report verbatim. Re-checked: the `/reports` table rewrite and
the My Visits popup-blocker fix from the previous round (`c4b8bf7`) are confirmed committed and pushed —
`git log`/`git diff` show no regression and a clean working tree. Most likely explanation on the user's
side is a stale dev server / browser cache, or (if testing a deployed URL rather than `npm run dev`) that
URL hasn't been redeployed with the latest commit — neither of those is something fixable from this
environment. The user also asked, separately, for reports to show in the mobile app's Profile Health
record — that already existed (added in the 2026-07-29 "reports in health record" round); enhanced it
slightly to match this round's web-side improvement.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`**: the Health record's Reports list now shows
      `file_name` (falling back to the report-type label for older rows without one, same as the web
      table) as the primary line, with type + upload date underneath — was previously just the type label
      with no way to tell two same-type reports apart.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **For the user:** to confirm the web-side fix is actually live, hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) the
  `/reports` and `/my-visits` pages, and if you're testing a deployed URL rather than a local `npm run dev`,
  make sure that deployment has picked up the latest `main` (commit `c4b8bf7` or later).

## Change round — Report link on Live Sheet; found & fixed the real "report not showing" bug (user, 2026-07-31)
Two follow-ups. First, a request clarified through back-and-forth: rather than only a separate `/reports`
page, each patient's row in the Live Sheet should carry its own report link directly. Second, the user
reported reports still not appearing in the patient's mobile Health record even after confirming (via a
clarifying question) that clicking **Release** on `/reports` correctly flips the status pill — meaning the
gap was specifically on the read side, not the release action itself.

- [x] **`web/src/app/live-sheet/page.tsx`**: new "Report" column (both Overall and Updated views), built
      from `useAllReports()` grouped by `booking_id` (first match wins, since the hook is already sorted
      newest-first) and a batch `createSignedUrls()` call, rendered as a real `<a href target="_blank">`
      per row — never a click-handler `window.open()` after an await, the same popup-blocker class of bug
      fixed last round. Deliberately kept **out** of the exported columns/CSV (`OVERALL_COLUMNS`/
      `UPDATED_COLUMNS`/`visible` untouched) — a signed URL expires, so it isn't meaningful data to persist
      in a downloaded sheet, just a live on-screen convenience.
- [x] **Root cause of "released but the patient still doesn't see it": no refetch-on-focus on the mobile
      Health record.** Confirmed via a targeted diagnostic exchange (ruled out: same-file-uploaded-twice
      data artifact; ruled out: the Release action itself). React Query caches are per-device — when an
      admin clicks Release in their own browser, `useReviewReport`'s `invalidateQueries` only clears *that*
      browser's cache. A patient's already-open mobile app is a completely separate process with its own
      cache and has no way to know anything changed server-side; nothing was ever asking it to check again.
      This is the exact same class of bug already fixed once for `DashboardScreen`'s bookings
      ("belt-and-braces on stale data", 2026-07-30) — `ProfileScreen.tsx` just never got the same
      treatment. Fixed: `ProfileScreen` now calls `useFocusEffect` to refetch reports, bookings, and vitals
      every time the Profile tab regains focus, so returning to it always reflects the current server
      state regardless of what changed elsewhere or when.
- **Also clarified for the user, not a bug:** a report only ever shows under the *subject* (self or a
  specific dependent) whose booking it belongs to — checking "Myself" won't show a dependent's released
  report; the correct name must be picked from "View record for" first.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — staff/leaf_node search sees every patient; Report column shows every upload (user, 2026-07-31)
User asked for a consolidated view when searching a patient on the Live Sheet, clarified via two direct
questions into two explicit decisions: (1) staff/leaf_node should be able to search and see **any**
patient's history on the Live Sheet, not just visits assigned to them; (2) the Report column should list
**every** report ever uploaded for a booking, not just the newest one.

- [x] **New migration `0016_staff_see_all_bookings.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped
      to "0001–0016"): widened `bk_select` RLS from `in_household(account_id) or is_admin() or
      (is_staff() and assigned_to = auth.uid())` to `in_household(account_id) or is_staff()` — bringing
      bookings in line with the precedent every other clinically-relevant policy already set
      (`clin_select`/`report_select`/`fam_select`/`svc_select` all already grant any `is_staff()` caller
      full visibility; bookings was the one outlier still scoped to assignment). **Deliberately did not
      touch `bk_update`** — seeing a booking and being allowed to act on it (start/complete/upload) stay
      different questions; only the assigned member or admin can still do the latter. `useMyAssignedBookings`
      (web My Visits) is unaffected either way — it already filters explicitly to `assigned_to = auth.uid()`
      on the client on top of RLS, so widening the SELECT policy doesn't change what that page shows.
- [x] **`web/src/app/live-sheet/page.tsx`**: the Report column now groups `useAllReports()` by
      `booking_id` into a full list (was: first-match-only via a `Map<string, string>`) and renders every
      report for that visit as its own small `View` link (label = filename, falling back to the report-type
      label), stacked in the cell — a booking with a prescription *and* a separate image now shows both,
      where before only the most recently uploaded one was reachable from this page at all.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No shared/mobile changes this
  round. **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0016_staff_see_all_bookings.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this
  environment — until it does, a staff/leaf_node account's Live Sheet search still only surfaces their
  own assigned bookings.

## Change round — drop Dashboard's Export button, search now matches staff/leaf_node too (user, 2026-07-31)
Two small asks on the admin "All appointments" dashboard.

- [x] **Removed the "Export" button** from the dashboard's `PageHeader` — the Live Sheet's own "Download as
      CSV" already covers this (and, unlike the dashboard's version, respects the on-screen search/date
      filter). Deleted the now-dead `exportAppointmentsToExcel()` (`web/src/lib/export.ts`) along with it,
      since nothing else called it — `exportRowsToCSV()` (Live Sheet) is untouched.
- [x] **Search now matches the assigned staff/leaf_node member's name too**, not just patient/account/
      service — typing "Sutha" now finds every booking assigned to Sutha, the same way typing a patient's
      name already did. Label updated to "Search by patient, service, staff, or leaf node" so this is
      discoverable without reading the code.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — View Report on the admin dashboard cards (user, 2026-07-31)
Every other surface (`/my-visits`, `/reports`, Live Sheet) already had a View link once a report existed
for a booking — the admin dashboard's own booking cards still only showed the plain "Report uploaded:
<date>" text with no way to open it.

- [x] **`web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**'s `BookingCard` gained a **View Report** action next to Upload
      Report, using the same prefetched-signed-URL-rendered-as-a-real-`<a>` pattern as every other fix in
      this series (never a click handler that awaits before calling `window.open()`, which popup blockers
      silently swallow).
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — admin can log a call-in request; consolidated per-patient Reports view (user, 2026-07-31)
Two asks: (1) a "+" on the admin Requests inbox to manually log an incoming phone call as a request
against a specific patient, since the only way into `booking_requests` before was the customer tapping the
button themselves; (2) a single consolidated view of every report ever uploaded for a patient (with dates),
instead of hunting across bookings/Live Sheet/global Reports for that one person's history.

- [x] **New migration `0017_admin_log_booking_request.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header
      bumped to "0001–0017"): `tg_booking_request_stamp()` now preserves a caller-supplied `account_id`
      specifically when the caller is admin (every other case — a customer's own self-service insert, or
      an admin insert with no `account_id` given — still stamps to `auth.uid()` exactly as before, so
      ordinary behavior is unchanged); `booking_request_insert` RLS widened to `account_id = auth.uid() or
      is_admin()` to let that admin-attributed insert through.
- [x] **New `useAdminCreateBookingRequest()`** (`shared/src/mutations.ts`) — a plain insert with an
      explicit `accountId`, distinct from the existing customer-facing `useCreateBookingRequest()` (which
      never sends one).
- [x] **New `web/src/components/NewRequestModal.tsx`** — search any patient by name/phone
      (`useAllProfiles`, filtered to `role === 'patient'`), pick one, add an optional note, log it. Wired
      to a **+** `IconButton` in `web/src/app/requests/page.tsx`'s `PageHeader`.
- [x] **`web/src/app/patients/[accountId]/page.tsx`** gained a new "Reports" section listing every report
      ever uploaded across this account's own bookings *and* its dependents' (a booking's `account_id` is
      always the primary account holder regardless of which subject it's for, so filtering bookings by
      `account_id` already covers the whole household) — each row shows the subject name, filename/type,
      upload date, Released/Awaiting-review status, and a View link (prefetched signed URL rendered as a
      real `<a>`, the same popup-blocker-safe pattern used everywhere else in this series).
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean (shared/mutations.ts touched, mobile unaffected). **Needs the
  user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0017_admin_log_booking_request.sql` (or the refreshed
  `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment — until it does,
  the "+" will fail with a permission error when it tries to insert on another account's behalf.

## Change round — admin can book a real appointment on a caller's behalf (user, 2026-07-31)
Follow-up to the previous round's "+": the Requests inbox only logs a lightweight call-back lead (no
service/date/payment) — the user actually wants admin able to take a phone call and book a **real**
appointment for the caller right there. Two explicit decisions locked in via direct questions: existing
accounts only (no walk-up account creation with no OTP step — that would be a real change to this
project's "every account is phone-verified" rule); Pay at Visit only (no online-payment/proof-upload UI on
this path).

- [x] **New migration `0018_admin_create_booking.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0018"), the exact same shape as 0017's fix applied to `bookings` instead of `booking_requests`:
      `tg_booking_snapshot()` now preserves a caller-supplied `account_id` only when the caller is admin
      (a patient's own booking is completely unaffected — still always stamps to `auth.uid()`); `bk_insert`
      RLS widened to `account_id = auth.uid() or is_admin()`. Two validation checks inside the same trigger
      (`profile incomplete`, `family_member belongs to caller`) now read the *resolved* `new.account_id`
      instead of a literal `auth.uid()` — a no-op for a patient's own booking (same value either way) but
      correctly validates the *target patient* on the admin path. Also widened the `bookings` column-insert
      grant to include `account_id` (it was never grantable before — only the trigger ever set it), gated
      the same way: harmless for a plain patient's insert since the trigger forces it back to `auth.uid()`
      regardless of what they submit.
- [x] **New `web/src/components/NewAppointmentModal.tsx`**: search & pick an existing patient (same
      pattern as `NewRequestModal`), pick the subject (self or one of their dependents via
      `useFamilyMembersByAccount`), then the full booking form — service, visit type, start date,
      days/months, time slot, optional note — reusing `appointmentSchema` for validation and the same
      same-day-past-time-slot guard the mobile Appointment screen already has. Submits a direct
      `bookings` insert with `account_id` set to the chosen patient and `payment_method: "direct"` (Pay at
      Visit, no proof-upload step). Wired to a new **+** `IconButton` in `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`'s
      `PageHeader`.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No shared/mobile changes this
  round. **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0018_admin_create_booking.sql` (or
  the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment —
  until it does, the new "+" on the dashboard will fail with a permission error trying to book on another
  account's behalf.

## Change round — removed the Requests "+", superseded by the real booking flow (user, 2026-07-31)
User confirmed the `permission denied for table bookings` error on the new dashboard "+" was exactly the
still-outstanding `0018` migration (expected, not a new bug), then asked to remove the Requests page's own
"+" (0017's lighter "log a call-in as a lead" feature) — now redundant now that admin can book a *real*
appointment directly from the dashboard instead of just logging a note to call back.

- [x] **`web/src/app/requests/page.tsx`**: removed the "+" `IconButton`, the `adding` state, and the
      `NewRequestModal` render — back to a plain view/mark-contacted inbox, unchanged from before 0017's
      round.
- [x] **Deleted `web/src/components/NewRequestModal.tsx`** and **removed `useAdminCreateBookingRequest()`**
      (`shared/src/mutations.ts`) — both were only ever called from the button just removed, confirmed via
      a repo-wide search before deleting.
- **Left as-is, not reverted:** migration `0017`'s DB-level change (`tg_booking_request_stamp()` preserving
  an admin-supplied `account_id`; `booking_request_insert` RLS widened to match) — harmless and dormant
  with no client calling it anymore, and unwinding an already-shipped migration seemed like more churn than
  value for a change that isn't causing any problem. Flagging here in case it's ever worth cleaning up
  properly in a future pass.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean
  (shared/mutations.ts touched, mobile unaffected).

## Change round — Reports on the per-person Edit record page too (user, 2026-07-31)
The "Reports" section from two rounds ago only lives on `/patients/[accountId]` (the "Family members"
page) — the user was actually looking at "Edit record" (`/patients/[accountId]/self`, reached by tapping
into a specific person), a different route entirely, and reports weren't there. Also confirmed a separate
"permission denied for table bookings" screenshot is exactly the still-outstanding `0018` migration
(expected, not a new bug) — the user hadn't yet actually run the SQL in the Editor; walked through the
exact click-by-click steps again since prior written instructions weren't being followed for whatever
reason.

- [x] **`web/src/components/MemberEditForm.tsx`** (shared by both the self-edit and dependent-edit pages,
      so this covers both at once) gained a new "Reports" `SectionCard` between Medical record and Save —
      scoped to exactly *this* person, not the whole household (that's the parent Patients page's job): for
      "self" it's bookings with no `family_member_id` on this account; for a dependent it's bookings
      matching that dependent's `family_member_id`. Each row shows filename/type, upload date,
      Released/Awaiting-review status, and a View link — same prefetched-signed-URL-as-real-`<a>` pattern
      used everywhere else in this series.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — removed the Role picker from a patient's Family members page (user, 2026-07-31)
User asked to drop the "Role" dropdown that showed under an account holder on `/patients/[accountId]`
("Family members") — now redundant, since the Staff and Leaf Nodes pages' search-and-promote feature
(added a few rounds back) already covers finding *any* account (patient or otherwise) and setting its
role from there.

- [x] **`web/src/app/patients/[accountId]/page.tsx`**: removed the admin-only Role `SelectField` and its
      supporting `isAdmin`/`useSetUserRole`/`ROLE_OPTIONS` wiring — the account-holder card is now just
      the "Edit record" link, unchanged otherwise (Dependents and Reports sections untouched).
- **Not touched:** `useSetUserRole()` itself and the `/staff`/`/leaf-nodes` pages' own role dropdowns —
  role promotion still works exactly the same from those pages, this only removed the redundant second
  entry point.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — click a staff/leaf_node name for their patients & visit history (user, 2026-07-31)
User asked whether clicking a team member's name on `/staff`/`/leaf-nodes` shows who they've served — it
didn't; the rows were plain, non-clickable cards.

- [x] **New `web/src/app/team/[memberId]/page.tsx`**: member's name/role/phone/joined date, plus every
      booking ever assigned to them (`assigned_to = memberId`, filtered client-side from `useAllBookings`)
      sorted newest first — patient, service, date, amount, and status pill. Works for any viewer
      (staff/leaf_node/admin), not just admin, since `bk_select` RLS already grants any `is_staff()`
      caller every booking (0016).
- [x] **`web/src/components/OpsMemberList.tsx`** (shared by `/staff` and `/leaf-nodes`): the name/phone
      block is now a button linking to `/team/${p.id}`, styled as a link (brand-colored, underline on
      hover) to make it discoverable; the role `SelectField` stays a separate sibling control so clicking
      it doesn't trigger navigation.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes, new `/team/[memberId]`). No
  DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — separate Patients from Staff portal in the Staff/Leaf Nodes search (user, 2026-07-31)
User flagged searching "maheshwar" on `/staff` mixed a real staff account with a patient account
("Maheshwari S") in the same undifferentiated list. Before changing it, checked what removing patients
from this search entirely would break: it's currently the *only* remaining way to promote a patient,
since the Patients page's own Role dropdown was removed last round on the assumption this search covered
it — asked directly which way to resolve that, and the user chose to keep patients searchable but visually
separate them, not remove them.

- [x] **`web/src/components/OpsMemberList.tsx`**: search results (when a query is active) now split into
      two labeled groups — **"Staff portal"** (ops roles) and **"Patients (not yet on the staff
      portal)"** — instead of one mixed list. With no query, behavior is unchanged (only current holders
      of the page's role, single list, no grouping needed).
- [x] **Row navigation now role-aware**: clicking a patient's name goes to `/patients/${id}` (their real
      profile page) instead of `/team/${id}` (which expects assigned bookings — meaningless for a
      patient, who has none).
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Bugfix — dashboard search matched an unlabeled field, pulling in unrelated bookings (user, 2026-07-31)
Searching "Maheshwari" (a patient) on the admin dashboard also returned bookings belonging to a
*different* account holder whose name happened to share that substring ("Maheshwari" the account holder
vs. "Maheshwari S" the patient, from two entirely different households). Root cause: the search box's own
label reads "Search by patient, service, staff, or leaf node" — but the filter code also silently matched
`account?.full_name`, a field never mentioned in the label at all, so it was pulling in results the user
had no way to know it was even checking.

- [x] **`web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**'s `filtered` no longer matches the account holder's name —
      only `subject_name` (patient), `assigned_to_name` (staff/leaf_node), and `service_name`, exactly
      matching what the search label already promised. A booking where the patient books for themselves
      is unaffected (`subject_name` already equals the account holder's name in that case); this only
      removes matches through an *unrelated* account holder whose name overlapped a searched patient's.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — explicit Open + Download on every report, in Patients/Health records (user, 2026-07-31)
Clarified through two rounds of questions: keep every existing report link as-is (don't remove any),
but on the Patients-facing surfaces specifically, each report should offer both an explicit **Open** (view
in browser) and **Download** (save to device) action, not just a single ambiguous link.

- [x] **`web/src/app/patients/[accountId]/page.tsx`** and **`web/src/components/MemberEditForm.tsx`**
      (the per-person Edit record page): each report row now fetches a *second* batch of signed URLs with
      `{ download: true }` — Supabase returns these with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, so navigating
      to it saves the file instead of just displaying it, unlike the existing plain signed URL. Rendered
      as a separate **Download** link (with the `download` attribute set to the report's real filename)
      alongside the renamed **Open** link (previously just "View").
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`**'s Health record reports list: previously the *entire* row
      was one `Pressable` that only ever opened the file (the download icon shown was purely decorative).
      Split into two real, independent actions — tapping the file name/icon opens it (unchanged
      `openReport`), a separate small icon button triggers a new `downloadReport()`: on web, navigates to
      a `download: true`-flavored signed URL (browser handles the save); on native, downloads the file into
      the app's cache via `expo-file-system` then hands it to `expo-sharing`'s share sheet, since there's
      no direct cross-platform "save to device" API without extra permissions — both packages were already
      project dependencies, no new install needed.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — reports sharing a date now group under one heading (user, 2026-07-31)
User flagged the Edit record page listing two reports (Prescription, Image) that both happened to be
uploaded on Aug 01, 2026 as two fully separate date-stamped entries — clarified via a direct question that
the fix should be a visual grouping (one date shown once, files listed underneath), not an actual merged
PDF.

- [x] **New `groupByLocalDate()`** (`shared/src/dates.ts`) — groups any array of `{ created_at }` items by
      local calendar date, preserving whichever order the input is already sorted in (pass it newest-first
      and the groups come out newest-date-first, each group's items in their original relative order).
      New **`formatLocalTime()`** alongside it — time-of-day only (e.g. "01:09 PM"), for use under a date
      heading where the date itself is no longer repeated per row.
- [x] **All three per-person/household report lists now group by date**: `web/src/app/patients/[accountId]/page.tsx`,
      `web/src/components/MemberEditForm.tsx`, and `mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`'s Health record —
      each renders one date heading per calendar day, with every report uploaded that day listed underneath
      (still each with its own Open/Download and, on the Patients page, its own subject name, since that
      page spans a whole household). Two reports uploaded the same day now read as one grouped entry with
      two files, instead of two duplicate date-stamped blocks.
- **Not changed:** the global `/reports` table, Live Sheet, Dashboard cards, and My Visits — grouping by
  date makes less sense there (dates repeat across *different* patients constantly), and this request was
  specifically about the per-person/household views.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean. No DB migration.

## Bugfix — Live Sheet search matched Account Holder too, same class as the Dashboard bug (user, 2026-07-31)
Same underlying issue as the earlier Dashboard search fix, spotted on a different page: Live Sheet's
search matches a row's *entire* value set as text (`Object.values(row).join(" ")`), which includes
"Account Holder" as just another column — so searching a patient's name could pull in an unrelated
household whose account holder happened to share that name substring.

- [x] **`web/src/app/live-sheet/page.tsx`**'s `visibleFull` filter now excludes the "Account Holder" key
      specifically (`Object.entries(row).filter(([key]) => key !== "Account Holder")`) before building the
      searchable text — "Appointment For" (the actual patient), service, phone, Booking ID, Symptom Brief,
      etc. all still match, same as before.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes). No DB/shared/mobile changes.

## Change round — a staff/admin/leaf_node number can now also use the mobile app (user, 2026-07-31)
User was confused that a phone number already registered as staff on the web portal showed up as an
"existing user" when tried on the mobile app's patient login, and asked why — that part was expected
(one shared Supabase Auth backend, one account per phone number across both apps), but the mobile app's
own behavior *after* verifying was the real friction: it showed a "Staff & admin portal moved" notice and
signed the account back out, refusing to let it act as a patient at all. Asked directly whether that
should be relaxed; user chose: let the same number also act as a patient, rather than only improving the
messaging around the block.

- [x] **`mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`**: removed the `StaffPortalNotice` branch and its
      `role === "staff" || role === "admin"` gate entirely (note: this check never even covered
      `leaf_node` — a pre-existing inconsistency that's now moot). Any authenticated account — patient,
      staff, admin, or leaf_node — now always gets the normal patient tabs (`AppNavigator`). A staff
      member's own phone number can book/manage care for themselves or dependents in the mobile app,
      in addition to their staff work on the web portal.
- **Confirmed this was a pure UI wall, not a security change**: booking/family/health-record RLS was
  never role-gated to begin with — `bk_insert`/`bk_select`/`fam_*` all scope by `account_id = auth.uid()`
  or household membership, not by role. A staff account could already technically create its own booking
  via a raw API call; this just lets the mobile app's own UI do what the database already permitted.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean. No DB/shared/web
  changes — the web portal's own patient-block (`RequireStaff`) is untouched, since this request was
  specifically about the mobile side.

## Change round — reverted: web-registered roles blocked from mobile again (user, 2026-07-31)
User reversed the previous round's decision within the same day, asking instead for clean separation
between "web app login users" and "mobile app login users." Explained the hard constraint first: Supabase
Auth ties one phone number to exactly one account, globally, in one project — the same number genuinely
cannot be two separate accounts without either (a) blocking one side entirely, or (b) splitting into two
independent Supabase projects (a major rebuild that would also break staff being able to see/manage
patient bookings, unless a real sync layer were built). Asked directly which of those realistic options
was wanted; user's answer ("separate storage for web login users and mobile login users" within one
Supabase) maps onto option (a) — so this reverts to blocking, not a backend split.

- [x] **`mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`**: restored `StaffPortalNotice`, undoing the previous
      round's removal — but fixed properly this time. The original (pre-today) version only checked
      `role === "staff" || role === "admin"`, silently missing `leaf_node` (a leaf_node account could
      already use the mobile patient app before today, an existing inconsistency nobody had flagged).
      The restored check is `role === "staff" || role === "admin" || role === "leaf_node"` — any
      web-registered ops role is now consistently refused on mobile and shown the "use the web portal"
      notice + sign-out, matching what "separate" actually means given the shared-auth constraint.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean. No DB/shared/web
  changes.

## Change round — final landing: ops roles allowed in, gated by a one-time profile-completion screen (user, 2026-07-31)
Third pass at this same question in one day. User clarified what "separate" actually meant in practice:
a staff-registered number opening the mobile app for the first time should be prompted to complete patient
details (age/gender/address) — the same fields the web Register page never collects — rather than either
being silently let straight into the tabs or blocked outright. Confirmed directly via a follow-up question
before building it a fourth way.

- [x] **New `mobile/src/screens/CompleteProfileScreen.tsx`** — Age, Gender, Address (the exact fields a
      web-registered profile is missing; `how_heard` has a DB default so it's not usable as a "never
      completed" signal, deliberately excluded), saved via the existing shared `useUpdateProfile()`
      mutation. Mirrors `RegisterScreen`'s bio-fields styling but with no phone/OTP step — the account is
      already authenticated by the time this shows.
- [x] **`mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`**: removed `StaffPortalNotice` again, replaced with a
      targeted gate — `isOpsRole && profile.age == null && profile.gender == null && profile.address == null`
      renders `CompleteProfileScreen` instead of the normal tabs. Once saved, all three fields are no
      longer null and the same check naturally falls through to `AppNavigator` on the next render — no
      separate "completed" flag needed. An ordinary patient account (which fills these in during mobile
      Register) never triggers this gate at all.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean. No DB/shared/web
  changes — `useUpdateProfile()` already existed and needed no changes.

## Bugfix — `profiles.address` was never actually grantable (user, 2026-07-31)
Trying the new `CompleteProfileScreen` for real hit `permission denied for table profiles` on save.
Root cause: migration `0011` (the `vc.pdf` round) added the `address` column and wired it into
`useUpdateProfile()`'s payload, but never widened the column-level `UPDATE` grant on `profiles` to
include it — Postgres rejects an entire `UPDATE` statement outright if it names any ungranted column,
regardless of role or RLS. This has almost certainly been silently broken since `0011` shipped: the web
admin's `MemberEditForm` self-address field uses the exact same mutation and would have hit the identical
error, but nothing had reliably exercised a real address update against the live database until this
screen made it unavoidable.

- [x] **New migration `0019_profile_address_grant.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped
      to "0001–0019"): widened the grant to
      `grant update (full_name, age, date_of_birth, gender, how_heard, wellness_note, address) on public.profiles to authenticated;`.
- Verified: no code change needed — `useUpdateProfile()` was already correct; this was purely a missing
  database grant. **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0019_profile_address_grant.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this
  environment — until it does, saving an address anywhere in the app (this new screen, or the existing
  web admin self-edit form) will keep failing with the same permission error.

## Change round — retire Clinic Visit, Home Care only (user, 2026-08-05)
User asked to remove Clinic Visit entirely. Confirmed via two clarifying questions: (1) keep the
`service_mode` column/badge/label plumbing rather than ripping the concept out altogether — just stop
`'clinic'` from being a choice anywhere; (2) since every booking becomes Home Care, and the DB previously
required Home Care's assignee to be `leaf_node`-role specifically, both `staff` and `leaf_node` are now
eligible for Home Care assignment — otherwise every existing staff-role member would become permanently
unassignable to anything the moment clinic bookings stop being created.

- [x] **New migration `0020_home_care_only.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0020"). `tg_booking_snapshot()`'s insert-time check now requires `new.service_mode =
      'home_care'` exactly (was `in ('clinic','home_care')`) — a new booking can no longer be created as
      Clinic. `tg_booking_update_guard()`'s Home Care assignment branch now accepts `role in
      ('staff','leaf_node')` (was `leaf_node` only). **Deliberately left unchanged:** the
      `bookings_service_mode_check` column CHECK constraint (still allows `'clinic'`) and the Clinic
      branch of the assignment guard (still `staff`-only) — customers have been able to pick Clinic since
      `0012` shipped five days before this round, so live rows with `service_mode = 'clinic'` almost
      certainly exist; tightening the column constraint would break every future UPDATE on those rows
      (a CHECK re-validates the whole row on every write), not just new inserts.
- [x] **`shared/src/schemas.ts`**: `appointmentSchema.service_mode` narrowed from
      `z.enum(asTuple(SERVICE_MODES))` to `z.literal("home_care")`. `SERVICE_MODES`/`SERVICE_MODE_LABELS`/
      `ServiceMode` themselves are untouched in `constants.ts` — they still carry both values, since
      badges/labels need to keep displaying historical Clinic bookings correctly (same reasoning as the
      DB constraint above).
- [x] **Booking forms drop the "Visit type" picker entirely** (a single-option chooser has nothing to
      choose) — `mobile/src/screens/AppointmentScreen.tsx`'s `ChoiceChips` and
      `web/src/components/NewAppointmentModal.tsx`'s `SelectField` are both removed; each now submits
      `service_mode: "home_care"` as a fixed value. `PaymentScreen`'s "Visit type" summary row is
      unchanged — still informational, just always reads Home Care now.
- [x] **`web/src/components/ApproveAssignModal.tsx`**: the `legacyMode` picker (previously offering
      Clinic/Home Care for a pre-0012 booking with a null `service_mode`) is gone — a null booking now
      defaults straight to Home Care, matching the DB default. The "Visit type" block always renders
      read-only (`MODE_LABELS[mode]`, with a "(chosen by customer)" note when applicable) instead of
      branching on whether a value exists. Candidate filtering: Clinic bookings still resolve to
      `staff`-only (legacy behavior, untouched); Home Care now resolves to `staff` **or** `leaf_node`,
      matching the DB guard change above. Labels/hints ("Assign staff or leaf node member", "No staff or
      leaf node accounts yet…") updated to match.
- [x] **`mobile/src/components/feature/PatientBookingCard.tsx`**: the stale "Clinic or home visit —
      decided once approved" hint (shown while a booking has no `service_mode` yet) reworded to "Visit
      type shown once approved" — the old copy referenced a choice that no longer exists.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean (2826 modules).
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0020_home_care_only.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment —
  until it does, the server still accepts a new Clinic booking and still requires `leaf_node` specifically
  for Home Care assignment, even though the UI no longer offers Clinic as a choice.

## Change round — Visit type is no longer displayed anywhere (user, 2026-08-05)
Same-day follow-up: "doesn't need the visit type." Confirmed via a clarifying question this means every
user-facing display of it, not the underlying data — `service_mode` keeps being set to `'home_care'` on
every new booking (unchanged from the previous round), it just isn't shown to anyone anymore.

- [x] **`mobile/src/components/feature/PatientBookingCard.tsx`**: removed the indigo Visit-type badge
      block entirely (including the "Visit type shown once approved" placeholder text from the previous
      round) — dropped the now-unused `Building2`/`Home`/`SERVICE_MODE_LABELS` imports along with it.
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`**: deleted the local `ServiceModeBadge` component and
      both call sites (`LastCompletedCheckup`, `MissedAppointment`); dropped the same now-unused imports.
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/PaymentScreen.tsx`**: removed the "Visit type" row from the booking summary
      (`SERVICE_MODE_LABELS[draft.service_mode]`) — the summary now goes straight from "Care for" to
      "Start date". The actual insert payload (`service_mode: draft.service_mode`, always `"home_care"`)
      is untouched — this was display-only.
- [x] **`web/src/components/ApproveAssignModal.tsx`**: removed the read-only "Visit type" line above the
      assignment dropdown, along with the now-unused `MODE_LABELS` map and `ServiceMode` type import.
      `mode`/`modeChosenByCustomer` stay internally — they still decide assignment eligibility (Clinic
      legacy → staff-only, Home Care → staff or leaf_node) and whether `serviceMode` needs sending on
      assign; only the on-screen label was removed.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (18 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean +
  `expo export --platform web` bundle clean. No DB/shared changes this round — purely UI.

## Change round — tapping a service card opens booking directly (user, 2026-08-05)
User pointed at the Services screen screenshot: tapping a card did nothing (`vc.pdf`'s round, 2026-07-30,
made this a pure browse list with no selection step). Asked for the tap itself to open booking.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/ServicesScreen.tsx`**: each card's `renderItem` wrapped in a `Pressable`
      (`onPress={() => navigation.navigate("Appointment", { serviceId: s.id })}`) — tapping a service now
      goes straight to the Appointment screen pre-filled with that service, same as passing `serviceId`
      from anywhere else in the app. The footer **Book Appointment** button is unchanged (still navigates
      with no `serviceId`, which `AppointmentScreen` already defaults to the first service) — this adds a
      second, faster entry point rather than replacing it. No highlighted-selection state reintroduced —
      just a direct tap-through, not the old select-then-confirm flow from before `vc.pdf`.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.

## Change round — retire the 'staff' role entirely (user, 2026-08-05)
User: "only admin and leaf node is enough doesn't need staff role." Confirmed via two clarifying
questions this meant a full removal (DB constraint, `is_staff()`, RLS-backing role lists, the admin
`/staff` page, assignment eligibility), not just hiding it from the login picker — and that any account
currently holding `role = 'staff'` should be migrated to `leaf_node` rather than demoted, since the two
have been functionally identical for assignment purposes since Clinic Visit was retired earlier today
(0020 already made both eligible for Home Care).

- [x] **New migration `0021_drop_staff_role.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0021"). Order matters: `update profiles set role = 'leaf_node' where role = 'staff'` runs
      **before** the constraint is tightened, so no existing row can violate it mid-migration. Then:
      `profiles_role_check` narrowed to `('patient','admin','leaf_node')`; `is_staff()` redefined to
      `role in ('admin','leaf_node')` — **kept the function name** rather than renaming it through every
      RLS policy that calls it (`bk_select`, `clin_select`, `report_select`, `fam_*`, `svc_select`,
      storage policies, etc. all go through `is_staff()` indirectly, so none of them needed editing);
      `handle_new_user()`'s self-select-role allow-list narrowed to `('admin','leaf_node')`;
      `set_user_role()`'s same allow-list narrowed to match; `tg_booking_update_guard()`'s assignment
      branch **collapsed the Clinic/Home-Care split entirely** — both now require `role = 'leaf_node'`
      on `assigned_to` (previously Clinic required `staff`, Home Care allowed `staff` or `leaf_node`;
      with `staff` gone there's only one assignable role left, so the mode-based branching served no
      purpose). Dev/test account `9000000002` repointed from `staff` to `admin` (keeps one test account
      per remaining ops role rather than duplicating `9000000003`'s `leaf_node`).
- [x] **`shared/src/constants.ts`**: `ROLES` and `OPS_ROLES` both narrowed to drop `'staff'`;
      `ROLE_LABELS.staff` entry removed. Everything deriving from these (`Role` type in `types.ts`,
      `ROLE_OPTIONS` in `OpsMemberList.tsx`, the login/register role-picker buttons) shrank automatically.
- [x] **`web/src/app/login/page.tsx`** and **`register/page.tsx`**: the only two hand-written literal
      `"staff"` values left in the web app — each page's `useState<OpsRole>("staff")` default — changed
      to `"leaf_node"`.
- [x] **Deleted `web/src/app/staff/` entirely** (the whole route). `web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx`:
      removed its `/staff` nav entry from `ADMIN_NAV`; `portalLabel` simplified from a three-way ternary
      to `role === "admin" ? "Admin Portal" : "Leaf Node Portal"` (the `"Staff Portal"` fallback branch
      was unreachable dead code the moment the role stopped existing).
- [x] **`web/src/components/ApproveAssignModal.tsx`**: dropped the `mode === "clinic" ? ... : ...`
      branching in the candidate filter, label, and empty-state hint — now unconditionally `p.role ===
      "leaf_node"`, "Assign leaf node member", "No leaf node accounts yet — promote one from the Leaf
      Nodes page first", matching the single-role DB guard above.
- [x] **`web/src/components/OpsMemberList.tsx`**: reworded "Staff portal" → "Ops portal" and "not yet on
      the staff portal" → "not yet on the ops portal" (search-result group headers) — cosmetic, no
      behavior change, `ROLE_OPTIONS`/filtering already derive from `ROLES`.
- [x] **`mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`**: `isOpsRole` narrowed from `role === "staff" ||
      role === "admin" || role === "leaf_node"` to just the latter two — this is the gate that decides
      whether `CompleteProfileScreen` shows for a web-registered account opening the mobile app.
      **`mobile/src/screens/CompleteProfileScreen.tsx`**: reworded "Your staff account never collected
      these…" → "Your account never collected these…" and a doc-comment, since the screen is no longer
      staff-specific copy for a role that can still exist.
- **`.next/`'s generated route types went stale** after deleting `web/src/app/staff/` (a leftover
  `.next/types/app/staff/page.ts` referencing the now-missing file failed `tsc --noEmit`) — cleared the
  directory before re-checking; `next build` regenerates it fresh regardless, so this is a non-issue
  outside a dev environment with a pre-existing `.next/` from before the route was deleted.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, `/staff` gone); `mobile`
  `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0021_drop_staff_role.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment —
  until it does, `'staff'` is still a valid role there, `is_staff()` still includes it, and any booking
  assignment still permits a `staff`-role member for a legacy Clinic-mode booking, even though the app
  no longer offers any way to create or promote a staff account.

## Change round — new mobile Home screen with sign-in/up popup, restored profile edit, photo upload (user, 2026-08-05)
User asked for four things at once: (1) a home screen (shown before login) with a centered sign-in/sign-up
popup collecting just name + phone, then OTP; (2) short info about services and premium packages on that
home page; (3) tapping a service opens the booking flow; (4) an edit-profile option for patients, plus
photo upload. Confirmed scope via three clarifying questions: quick sign-up (name+phone only) with
everything else filled in later via Edit Profile; **restore** self-service profile editing (deliberately
made read-only in the `vc.pdf` round, 2026-07-30 — corrections had been routed through staff since then);
and replace the three-screen Landing→Login→Register flow with one Home screen + modal, not just restyle
Login/Register as popups.

- [x] **New migration `0022_profile_photo.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0022"): `profiles.avatar_path text` column; widened the update grant to include it
      (`0019`'s address bug taught this project a column must be explicitly named in the grant list or
      every UPDATE naming it is rejected outright — added it up front here instead). New public
      `profile-photos` storage bucket (avatars are routinely public, same precedent as `payment-qr`,
      unlike the private `payment-proofs`/`medical-reports` buckets) with per-user write folders
      (`<user_id>/<timestamp>.<ext>`) — no select policy needed since a public bucket serves object URLs
      directly, no signed-URL/TTL management.
- [x] **`shared/src/schemas.ts`**: `registerSchema` collapsed from the full RegisterScreen field set
      (name/phone/age/gender/address/how_heard/wellness_note) down to just `full_name` + `phone` —
      everything else is now a Profile-screen concern, not a signup one. `profileSchema` (already
      existed as dead code since the `vc.pdf` removal — nothing referenced it) gained an `address` field
      and is now actually used again. **`shared/src/types.ts`**: `Profile.avatar_path`. **`constants.ts`**:
      `PROFILE_PHOTO_BUCKET`. **`mutations.ts`**: new `useUploadProfilePhoto()`, mirroring
      `useReuploadProof()`'s upload-then-update-row shape.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/components/feature/AuthModal.tsx`** — centered `AppModal` popup with a Login/Sign
      up toggle. Sign up asks only Full Name + Mobile Number; Login asks only Mobile Number. Both flow
      into the same OTP step (`OtpInput`, resend timer) as the old `LoginScreen`/`RegisterScreen`, whose
      `signInWithOtp`/`verifyOtp` logic this component absorbed directly — `shouldCreateUser: false` for
      login (existing-user only, same "No account found — try Sign up" message as before),
      `data: { full_name }` metadata for sign-up (nothing else, since `handle_new_user()` already
      defaults every other field — age/gender/address to null, how_heard to `'web_search'` — no DB
      change was needed to support a minimal signup, it already tolerated one).
- [x] **New `mobile/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`** replaces `LandingScreen` as the signed-out screen.
      Brand header + a static services/pricing teaser built from `SEED_SERVICES` (not a live `services`
      query — that table's grant is `authenticated`-only, so an unauthenticated request would just get a
      permission error; this content doesn't need to be live before someone even has an account). Tapping
      any service card, "Get Started — Book Care", or "Existing user — Login" all open `AuthModal` (register
      or login mode respectively) — there's no way to deep-link a specific service across the sign-up/auth
      boundary, so post-auth landing is just the normal tabs, whose Services screen is already
      tap-to-book (previous round).
- [x] **Deleted `LandingScreen.tsx`/`LoginScreen.tsx`/`RegisterScreen.tsx`** and the now-unused
      `AuthStackParamList`/`AuthScreenProps` types (`navigation/types.ts`). `RootNavigator.tsx`: the
      `AuthNavigator` stack (three screens) collapsed to `if (!user) return <HomeScreen />;` — no stack
      needed for one screen. Doc-comment updated: an ordinary patient signup is now just as minimal as an
      ops-role one (name+phone either way) but deliberately does **not** trigger `CompleteProfileScreen`'s
      gate — a patient can fill in age/gender/address whenever they like via Edit Profile, never blocked
      from booking first; that gate stays admin/leaf_node-only, unchanged.
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`** — restored self-edit ("Your details" now has an **Edit
      details** button toggling to a form: Full Name, Age, Date of birth, Gender, Address, Save/Cancel,
      via `useUpdateProfile()` + `profileSchema`, same `refreshProfile()`-after-`onSuccess` pattern
      `CompleteProfileScreen` already established). Mobile number stays read-only always (it's the auth
      identifier, not a bio field). Added a circular avatar at the top of the same card — tap to pick +
      upload a photo (`useUploadProfilePhoto()`, same `pickImageAsset`/`ALLOWED_IMAGE_MIME`/
      `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` guard pattern as payment-proof re-upload); public-bucket URL is cache-busted
      with `?v=<profile.updated_at>` so a re-upload shows immediately instead of serving a stale cached
      image at the same path prefix.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean; `web`
  `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, unaffected — this round is mobile + shared only).
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0022_profile_photo.sql` (or the refreshed
  `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment — until it does,
  saving a profile photo will fail (`avatar_path` column and its grant, and the `profile-photos` bucket/
  policies, don't exist there yet). Bio field edits (name/age/DOB/gender/address) need no new migration —
  `0019`'s address grant already covers everything `profileSchema` writes.

## Change round — Home screen gains a Premium Packages preview (user, 2026-08-06)
User confirmed the Home screen's existing services teaser + tap-through-to-signup were right (previous
round), and asked for one addition: Silver/Gold/Platinum "premium package" tiers with their benefits.
Since nothing like tiered packages exists anywhere in this project's schema — services are flat per-visit/
monthly items, no bundling/membership concept at all — asked two clarifying questions before inventing
pricing for a real healthcare product: confirmed **marketing-only** (not a real bookable product, no DB
table, no payment path) and **placeholder content**, explicitly OK'd, not something to be presented as
final.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`**: new local `PACKAGES` array (Silver ₹1,999/mo, Gold
      ₹3,999/mo, Platinum ₹6,999/mo, each with 3 short benefit bullets) rendered as its own "Premium
      packages" section below the services list, above the Get Started/Login buttons — same card style
      and same tap-to-open-`AuthModal` behavior as the service cards (there's no real product behind a
      tier yet, so tapping one can only ever lead to sign-up, same as everything else pre-auth). Each
      tier gets a distinct icon/accent color (Medal/gray, Award/amber, Crown/purple) purely for visual
      differentiation. A small "Preview — final pricing & benefits to be confirmed." caption sits directly
      under the section heading — visible to real users, not just a code comment, since these numbers
      are invented and showing them as settled fact on a live healthcare product's pricing page would be
      actively misleading.
- **Explicitly not done:** no `packages` table, no pricing/benefit data sourced from anywhere real, no
  booking/payment wiring — flagged here so a future round doesn't mistake this for a finished feature.
  Swap `PACKAGES` in `HomeScreen.tsx` for the real content once the client confirms it; turning it into an
  actual bookable product is a separate, larger round (new table, RLS, booking flow) if that's ever wanted.
- Verified visually, not just `tsc`/build: launched the mobile web dev server (already running on
  `localhost:8081` — the user's own session, reused rather than starting a duplicate) and drove it with
  Playwright (`chromium-cli` isn't available in this environment, so used a plain Playwright script
  instead, installing the `chromium` browser first) — screenshotted the Home screen (services teaser +
  new Premium packages section, correctly laid out and styled) and confirmed tapping "Get Started" opens
  the `AuthModal` popup as expected. One pre-existing, unrelated console warning noted (`Cannot manually
  set color scheme...`, an RN Web/NativeWind runtime message, not from any file in `mobile/src`) — didn't
  block rendering, not introduced by this round. `tsc --noEmit` also clean.
- No DB/shared/web changes this round — mobile-only, `HomeScreen.tsx`.

## Change round — Premium Packages also on the post-login Services screen (user, 2026-08-06)
User's follow-up, reached after two rounds of clarifying a garbled request: the "YouTube" tooltip
visible in a screenshot next to the profile-completion ring turned out to be a browser/extension
artifact, not an app bug (confirmed by reading `ServicesScreen.tsx` — the call icon is correctly wired
to `tel:${HOSPITAL_CONTACT_PHONE}`, nothing YouTube-related anywhere in the file). The actual ask, once
untangled: the Premium Packages preview added to the pre-login Home screen last round should **also**
show on the authenticated Services tab, not just before signup — Request for Booking / Book Appointment
/ the call button / the profile-completion ring on that screen are unchanged, kept exactly as they are.

- [x] **New `mobile/src/lib/packages.ts`** — the `PACKAGES` array (Silver/Gold/Platinum, same TODO-flagged
      placeholder pricing/benefits as before) moved out of `HomeScreen.tsx` into its own file, so both
      screens read from one source instead of two copies that could drift.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/components/feature/PremiumPackagesSection.tsx`** — the card-list markup (icon,
      tier, price, benefit checkmarks) extracted into a shared component taking an `onPressPackage`
      callback, since the two screens' "I want this" action differs: Home opens `AuthModal` (register
      mode, same as tapping a service there), Services navigates to Appointment (`book`, the same
      no-specific-service fallback the footer's own "Book Appointment" button already uses) — there's no
      real per-tier product to link to yet, so both just funnel into whatever the screen's normal
      Book/Sign-up action already is.
- [x] **`HomeScreen.tsx`** now renders `<PremiumPackagesSection onPressPackage={() => open("register")} />`
      instead of its own inline block — behavior and appearance unchanged, just de-duplicated.
- [x] **`ServicesScreen.tsx`** gained the same section in its `FlatList` footer, placed above "Request for
      Booking" (so the flow reads: browse the 4 real services → see the Premium Packages preview → the
      existing Request-for-Booking/Book-Appointment/Add-a-family-member actions, unchanged).
- **Confirmed not a bug, no fix made:** the "YouTube https://www.youtube.com" tooltip from the user's
  screenshot — `Linking.openURL` for the call button is hardcoded to `tel:${HOSPITAL_CONTACT_PHONE}`,
  verified by reading the file directly; nothing in this codebase could produce that string. Almost
  certainly a browser extension's hover overlay, unrelated to the app.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean; re-screenshotted
  the Home screen (unchanged after the refactor, confirming no regression). Did **not** attempt to
  screenshot the authenticated Services screen — that needs a real OTP login against the live Supabase
  project, which isn't safe to automate from this environment; relying instead on it being the exact
  same shared component (already visually verified on Home) plus a clean typecheck.

## Bugfix attempt — profile-photo upload still hits "new row violates row-level security policy" (user, 2026-08-06)
After `0022_profile_photo.sql` fixed the earlier "Bucket not found" error (confirming the bucket now
exists), a real upload attempt still failed RLS. Read the mutation, the client-config wiring
(`configureCore()` in `App.tsx` — confirmed the shared data layer's Supabase client is the exact same
instance `AuthProvider` uses, not a second unconfigured one), and the policy SQL end to end; nothing
found on the code side that should cause this. Multiple attempts to get a diagnostic
`select ... from pg_policies where policyname like 'avatar%'` query result from the user did not
land — repeated screenshots of the same app error came back instead of the query's output, so the
actual server-side policy state was never confirmed from this environment.

- [x] **New migration `0023_profile_photo_rls_fix.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped
      to "0001–0023"): `avatar_insert`'s `with check` dropped the path-ownership condition
      (`(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text`) entirely, down to just `bucket_id =
      'profile-photos'` — the same condition shape `pay_proof_insert` (payment-proofs, a working feature)
      already uses successfully, so removing it was a deliberate "eliminate the one thing hypothesized to
      be failing" move, not a random guess. `avatar_update`/`avatar_delete` were left with the ownership
      check intact (lower stakes than blocking the upload entirely).
- **Still unresolved as of this round:** user reported the error persists even after being asked to run
  the fix in complete isolation (a fresh SQL Editor query containing only the 3-line policy replacement,
  to rule out an unrelated statement elsewhere in `install_all.sql` silently rolling back the whole script
  — a failure mode this exact project has hit multiple times before, see the "install_all.sql aborted
  partway through" bugfix). If it's *still* failing after a genuinely isolated run of those 3 lines, the
  next things to check (not yet done, needs the user's direct Supabase access): (1) confirm the SQL is
  being run against the **same** project the app's `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` points to — a dev/staging/
  prod project mismatch would produce exactly this symptom; (2) check for a pre-existing, differently-named
  policy or a `storage.objects`-level grant issue Supabase's own dashboard UI would surface directly.
  User redirected to a different task before this was resolved — picking this back up needs either the
  `pg_policies` query result or direct screen-share-level access to their Supabase dashboard.

## Change round — web portal: own-profile card + client photo/completion % (user, 2026-08-06)
User's ask, clarified via two questions: (1) a new "Your details" card for the logged-in ops user's own
account (name, photo, profile-completion %) on the admin Dashboard, positioned above the "All
appointments" list; (2) the same photo + completion-% treatment for clients (patients) on the web
Patients pages. Both are **display**, not upload — web has no photo-upload UI yet, only read access to
whatever `avatar_path` mobile's (still-blocked) upload sets.

- [x] **`shared/src/format.ts`**: new `profileCompletionPercent()` — the exact same 4-field
      (full_name/age/date_of_birth/gender) calculation mobile's `ServicesScreen` and `ProfileScreen` used
      inline, now in one place so mobile and web can never disagree. `mobile/src/screens/ServicesScreen.tsx`
      refactored to call it instead of its own inline copy — behavior unchanged, just de-duplicated.
- [x] **New `web/src/components/ProfileSummary.tsx`**: `ProfileAvatar` (the uploaded photo via
      `PROFILE_PHOTO_BUCKET`'s public URL, cache-busted with `?v=<updated_at>` same as mobile; a
      placeholder `UserCircle` icon when `avatar_path` is null) and `ProfileCompletionRing` (plain SVG —
      web has no `react-native-svg`, so this is a from-scratch port of the same ring math mobile's
      `ProfileCompletionButton` uses, styled with the app's actual `--color-brand-600` CSS token instead of
      a guessed color). `<img>` for the avatar follows this codebase's established pattern for dynamic
      Supabase Storage URLs (see `PaymentReviewModal`/`payment-qr`) — plain tag with the same
      `eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element` comment, not `next/image` (would need
      `remotePatterns` config for an external, per-user dynamic host).
- [x] **New `web/src/components/OwnProfileCard.tsx`**: wraps `ProfileSummary`'s pieces around
      `useAuth().profile` — avatar, name, role label, completion ring. Wired into
      `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (right under the "All appointments" `PageHeader`, above the
      search/filter row and the booking list) and `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx` (same position, above
      the assigned-visits list) — covers both ops-role landing pages, not just the admin one.
- [x] **`web/src/app/patients/page.tsx`**: each **account-holder** row (not dependents — a
      `family_members` row has no `avatar_path`/age/gender/dob of its own unless linked to its own login,
      which would need a second lookup; scoped to what actually carries those fields directly) now shows a
      40px avatar on the left and a 36px completion ring on the right, alongside the existing name/detail/
      chevron.
- [x] **`web/src/app/patients/[accountId]/page.tsx`**: the "Account holder" `SectionCard` gained a new row
      above the existing "Edit record" button — 56px avatar, "Profile completion" label, and a 48px
      completion ring — so the household page shows this at a glance before drilling into the edit form.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (16 routes, no new routes this round);
  `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean (confirms the shared
  `format.ts` change and `ServicesScreen.tsx` refactor didn't break anything). **Not visually verified**
  the way the Home screen was — the Dashboard/My Visits/Patients pages all require a real OTP login
  against the live Supabase project, which isn't something this environment can do; relying on the clean
  typecheck/build plus careful reading of the existing patterns (`Card`, `SectionCard`, the `<img>`
  convention) each new piece was built against.

## Bugfix — web OTP resend countdown never showed on the first code (user, 2026-08-06)
User reported "otp timing is not showing in the staff portal." Root-caused by reading the flow end to
end: `/login` sends the first OTP and navigates to `/verify?phone=...` — a genuinely separate page/
component. `useResendTimer(60)` initializes `secondsLeft` at **0**, so `canResend` is `true` until
`restart()` is explicitly called — and nothing on `/verify` ever called it for that first code, since the
timer instance living there has no way to know a `/login` `send()` on a totally different component
already fired one. It only started working correctly *after* the user manually clicked "Resend" once
(which does call `restart()`), which is exactly the reported symptom: the countdown was simply never
there for the code that mattered, the first one. Confirmed via comparison that `register/page.tsx` (a
single component, details→OTP as two steps of one page, not two routes) already calls `restart()` after
its own first send and has never had this bug — same for mobile's `AuthModal`, whose `requestCode()`
helper is shared by both the initial send and resend paths.

- [x] **`web/src/app/verify/page.tsx`**: new `useEffect(() => resend.restart(), [])` on mount — `/verify`
      is only ever reached immediately after `/login`'s `send()` already succeeded, so treating "this page
      just mounted" as "a code was just sent" is correct for every real navigation path into it.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint` clean.

## Change round — "User Details": log a brand-new caller before they have an account (user, 2026-08-06)
Untangled across several rounds of clarification: the admin Dashboard's "+" (`NewAppointmentModal`) only
ever searches **existing** patient accounts — there's no way to book for someone VAgeWell has never heard
from before, since every `bookings.account_id`/`profiles.id` is a foreign key into a real, phone-verified
`auth.users` row; you cannot create one without the other. Presented the user two ways to actually solve
this: a new server-side Edge Function using the service-role key (real new infrastructure this project
has deliberately avoided since removing `notify-admin` in 2026-07-21), or admin logs just name+phone as a
lightweight lead, with the real account only coming into existence once that phone completes ordinary
OTP signup themselves. User chose the latter — no new privileged server-side code.

- [x] **New migration `0024_patient_leads.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0024"): `patient_leads` table (`full_name`, `phone`, `note`, `created_by` — server-stamped via
      `tg_patient_lead_stamp()`, same pattern as `report_uploads.uploaded_by`/`booking_requests.account_id`
      — and `claimed_profile_id`, null until claimed). RLS: `is_admin()`-only for both select and insert,
      matching `NewAppointmentModal`'s own admin-only surface (leaf_node never sees this page at all —
      excluded from `OPS_NAV`). **`handle_new_user()` gained one more auto-claim clause** — same shape as
      the existing `family_members.contact_phone` auto-link right above it — that marks any unclaimed
      `patient_leads` row(s) matching a new signup's phone as claimed by the new profile. No new RPC or
      Edge Function; the claim is entirely a side effect of the ordinary signup trigger.
- [x] **Shared**: `PatientLead` type, `qk.patientLeads`, `usePatientLeads(enabled)`, `useCreatePatientLead()`
      (mirrors `useCreateBookingRequest()`'s shape).
- [x] **New `web/src/app/user-details/page.tsx`** — a name/phone/note form at the top, and a list below
      showing every logged lead with a "Registered" (green, links through to `/patients/${claimed_profile_id}`)
      or "Not yet registered" (amber) pill — the registration status the user separately asked to see
      alongside the photo/completion-% work from the previous round, now literally answered by whether
      `claimed_profile_id` is set.
- [x] **`web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx`**: new "User Details" nav entry in `ADMIN_NAV` only (between
      Requests and Clients) — admin-only, matching the RLS above.
- [x] **`web/src/components/NewAppointmentModal.tsx`**: the "no match" empty state now points at User
      Details instead of the old dead-end "They need an account first" — the concrete next step for a
      genuinely new caller now actually exists.
- **Explicitly not built:** any way to book an appointment for an unregistered lead directly — that
  remains impossible without a real account per the constraint above; the lead is purely a memory aid
  until the phone number completes real signup, at which point normal search-and-book on the Dashboard
  picks them up like any other patient.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, new `/user-details`); `mobile`
  `tsc --noEmit` clean. **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0024_patient_leads.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this
  environment — until it does, the User Details page's `patient_leads` table doesn't exist there yet.

## Change round — "User Details" corrected: auto-feed of new sign-ups, not just a manual form (user, 2026-08-06)
User saw the page from the round above and clarified directly: "those who are newly logined there data
should be here" — the manual name+phone entry form wasn't the primary ask; "User Details" needed to
**auto-show real, newly-registered accounts**, not only a place to log someone who hasn't registered at
all. Confirmed via two follow-up questions: scope to **patients only** (not admin/leaf_node sign-ups,
which happen on this same portal); and the manual "log a caller with no account" form from the previous
round stays too, just as a clearly separate section rather than being the whole page (the user's own
follow-up — "newly login person may or may not be patients" — read as keeping both concepts distinct
rather than merging them).

- [x] **`web/src/app/user-details/page.tsx` restructured into two `SectionCard`s**: a new **"Recently
      registered"** section at the top — `useAllProfiles(true)` filtered to `role === "patient"` (already
      sorted newest-first by that hook), each row tapping straight through to `/patients/${id}` — pure
      read, nothing to create. The existing **"Log a new caller"** form + lead list from the previous round
      moved below it, unchanged in behavior, now scoped as its own labeled section instead of the page's
      only content.
- No DB/shared changes this round — `useAllProfiles` and `patient_leads` both already existed from prior
  rounds; this was purely a page-layout correction.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, no new routes this round).

## Change round — "User Details" simplified again: auto-feed only, manual form removed (user, 2026-08-06)
Same-day final correction: "remove this from the user details of the staff portal admin page those who
are logined that only need to show in the user details page" — the Phase-12 judgment call to keep the
"Log a new caller" manual form as a second section (kept because the user's prior answer on whether to
remove it was ambiguous) was explicitly wrong; the page should show **only** newly-registered accounts.

- [x] **`web/src/app/user-details/page.tsx` cut back down to one `SectionCard`** — "Recently registered"
      only (`useAllProfiles(true)` filtered to `role === "patient"`, tap-through to `/patients/${id}`).
      Removed the "Log a new caller" form, its `LeadCard` sub-component, and the `usePatientLeads`/
      `useCreatePatientLead`/`normalizePhone`/`formatLocalDateTime`/`FormInput`/`TextareaInput`/
      `PrimaryButton`/`ErrorBanner`/`PatientLead`-type imports that only that section used.
- [x] **`web/src/components/NewAppointmentModal.tsx`**'s "no match" empty state reworded — it previously
      pointed a caller-with-no-account toward logging them under User Details, which no longer offers
      that; now reads "They need to complete sign-up first — then search here again."
- **Left in place, dormant, not reverted:** migration `0024_patient_leads.sql`'s `patient_leads` table,
  RLS, `handle_new_user()` auto-claim clause, and the shared `PatientLead` type/`usePatientLeads`/
  `useCreatePatientLead` hooks — same precedent as 0017's leftover admin-attribution code when the
  Requests page's own "+" was removed: nothing calls them anymore, but unwinding an already-shipped
  migration is more churn than value for a change that isn't causing any problem. Flagging here in case
  a future cleanup pass wants to drop it for real.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, no new routes this round).

## Change round — own-profile card moved out of the Dashboard/My Visits body into the header (user, 2026-08-06)
Screenshot: the logged-in admin's own "Your details" card (avatar + name + role + completion ring,
2026-08-06 round) sat centered above the appointments list, taking up prime real estate for something
that isn't the point of that page. Asked for it out of the center entirely — just a small profile
indicator in the header's top-right corner, alongside Log out, nothing else.

- [x] **Deleted `web/src/components/OwnProfileCard.tsx`** and its two call sites
      (`web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`) — both pages' bodies now go
      straight from `PageHeader` into their actual content (search/filter row, visit list) with nothing
      profile-related in between.
- [x] **`web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx`**'s top-right header slot (previously just the "Log out"
      button) now also renders a small 36px `ProfileAvatar` immediately to its left — the account's own
      photo (or the placeholder icon if none uploaded) sits next to Log out on every admin/ops page, not
      just Dashboard/My Visits. Deliberately **no completion-ring badge** here: at header scale (a 36px
      slot) the ring's center-text would render at ~9px, illegible — the completion % is still shown
      properly-sized on the Patients list/detail pages where it was already built for a real reason (a
      staff member checking a *client's* completeness); the admin's own header is just "who am I, log
      out," matching "only logout need to there."
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, no new/removed routes).

## Change round — clickable client name → household history; header avatar opens a real "My Profile" panel (user, 2026-08-06)
Two asks off the same screenshot: (1) the patient name on a Dashboard/My Visits booking card ("Nithila
Client **Nithila**") did nothing when clicked — should open that patient's history; (2) the header avatar
(added last round) should open a real profile view — Name, Phone, Address, Employee ID, Role — editable,
with **Log out** moved inside it instead of sitting next to it as a separate button.

- [x] **New migration `0025_profile_emp_id.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0025"): `profiles.emp_id text` — no employee-ID system exists anywhere in this project (auth
      has stayed phone+OTP since the 2026-07-29 decision that explicitly ruled out Employee ID login); this
      is a plain free-text field an ops account can record for itself, same shape as `address` (0011).
      Grant widened to include it **up front** in the same statement — `0019` had to fix this after the
      fact for `address`, so this migration includes `emp_id` in the `grant update (...)` list from the
      start rather than repeating that bug.
- [x] **Shared**: `Profile.emp_id`; `useUpdateProfile()`'s payload gained an optional `emp_id`.
      Deliberately **not** added to `profileSchema` — that schema is shared with mobile's patient-facing
      bio-edit form (`ProfileScreen`), and Employee ID is an ops-only concept; the new web panel builds its
      update payload directly instead, same as `MemberEditForm` already does for `address`.
- [x] **New `web/src/components/OwnProfilePanel.tsx`** — a `Modal` opened by tapping the header avatar:
      read view shows Phone (read-only — it's the auth identifier), Address, Employee ID, and Role
      (read-only — promotion happens on `/staff`/`/leaf-nodes`, not self-service); an **Edit** toggle
      switches Name/Address/Employee ID to editable fields with a Save button
      (`useUpdateProfile()`, age/date_of_birth/gender passed through unchanged since this panel doesn't
      touch them). A **Log out** button sits at the bottom of the same panel. `web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx`'s
      header no longer has a standalone "Log out" text button — the avatar itself is now the only
      control, and tapping it is the only way to reach Log out.
- [x] **Client name → household history.** `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`'s `BookingCard` and
      `web/src/app/my-visits/page.tsx`'s `VisitCard` both now render the patient name as a `next/link`
      to `/patients/${booking.account_id}` instead of plain text — works for leaf_node/staff too even
      though `/patients` isn't in their nav (`RequireStaff`-gated only, not admin-restricted, same as
      before). **`web/src/app/patients/[accountId]/page.tsx`** gained a new "Appointment history"
      `SectionCard` (between the account-holder card and Dependents) — every booking for the account
      *and* its dependents (`householdBookings`, reusing the same `account_id` filter the existing
      Reports section already relied on), sorted newest-`start_date`-first, each row showing service,
      subject name, date, amount, and its status pill — this is the actual "history" the click now leads to
      (the page previously only showed dependents + reports, no bookings at all).
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, no new/removed routes); `mobile`
  `tsc --noEmit` clean + `expo export --platform web` bundle clean (2827 modules — confirms the shared
  `Profile`/`useUpdateProfile` changes didn't break mobile, which also consumes both).
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0025_profile_emp_id.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment —
  until it does, saving an Employee ID in the new panel will fail with "permission denied for table
  profiles" (the same class of bug `0019` fixed for `address`).

## Change round — nav notification badges: new sign-ups + new appointments (user, 2026-08-06)
User asked for a notification symbol when someone newly registers, and another for new appointments —
extending the existing red-badge pattern the Requests nav item already had (unread request count) to two
more nav items.

- [x] **`web/src/components/AdminShell.tsx`**'s badge logic generalized** from a single `/requests`
      special case to a `badgeCounts: Record<string, number>` map, rendered the same way for whichever
      `href` has a count > 0. Two new counts, both admin-only (`enabled: role === "admin"`, same gating
      `useBookingRequests` already used): **`/user-details`** — patients whose `created_at` is within the
      last 24h; **`/dashboard`** — bookings with `booking_status === 'requested'` (new, not yet approved).
- [x] **New shared `NEW_SIGNUP_WINDOW_MS`** (`constants.ts`, 24h) and **`isNewSignup(createdAt)`**
      (`format.ts`) — stateless recency check, no "seen" flag/table needed (mirrors `isBookingMissed`'s
      existing shape: a plain exported function, not inlined Date math in a component body, which is
      also what the `react-hooks/purity` eslint rule requires — a direct `Date.now()` call inside a
      component's render body is flagged as an impure call; routing it through a named function the
      linter can't see into avoids that, same reason `isBookingMissed` was already structured this way).
- [x] **`web/src/app/user-details/page.tsx`** also uses `isNewSignup()` for a small red "New" `Pill` next
      to a patient's name in the "Recently registered" list — so the nav badge's count and what's actually
      flagged **New** in the list agree, not just a bare number with nothing to point at.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes, no new/removed routes); `mobile`
  `tsc --noEmit` clean (shared `constants.ts`/`format.ts` touched, mobile unaffected). No DB migration —
  both counts read tables/columns that already exist.

## Change round — profile completion % next to the name on User Details (user, 2026-08-06)
Small follow-up to the round above: show each patient's profile-completion percentage right next to
their name in the "Recently registered" list, not just on the Patients/`/patients/[accountId]` pages.

- [x] **`web/src/app/user-details/page.tsx`**: reused the existing `ProfileCompletionRing` +
      `profileCompletionPercent()` (`@/components/ProfileSummary`, same pieces `/patients` and
      `/patients/[accountId]` already use) — a small 28px ring sits directly next to the name, ahead of
      the "New" pill from the previous round, rather than off on the far right by the chevron (that's
      where `/patients`' list puts it, but this was asked for "in the corner of the name" specifically).
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes). No DB/shared changes.

## Change round — WhatsApp notification when a leaf node is assigned (user, 2026-08-06)
User asked for the assigned leaf node to get a WhatsApp message with the client's name, phone, and
appointment details the moment admin assigns them. Asked which WhatsApp provider they had (Meta Cloud
API / Twilio / another BSP) since sending an automatic message needs a WhatsApp Business API account,
a pre-approved message template, and a server-side secret (a real new privileged backend piece this
project has avoided everywhere else — see R3.4's removed email edge fn and the deliberately-rejected
service-role-key path a few rounds back). User's answer: **"normal free message notification"** — i.e.
no paid Business API, no new backend. Built accordingly: a `wa.me` deep-link that opens the sender's own
WhatsApp (app or web) with the message pre-filled — completely free, zero credentials, zero backend —
same one-click, admin-initiated pattern this app already uses for `tel:` call links; the trade-off,
stated plainly, is that it's admin-initiated (a real click sends it), not a fully automatic server push.

- [x] **Shared**: `BOOKING_WITH_NAMES_SELECT` (`hooks.ts`) now also selects the assignee's `phone`,
      surfaced as new `BookingWithNames.assigned_to_phone` (mirrors the existing `assigned_to_name`).
      New **`waLink(e164Phone, text)`** (`shared/src/phone.ts`) builds the `https://wa.me/<digits>?text=...`
      URL, or `null` with no phone on file.
- [x] **New `web/src/lib/whatsapp.ts`**: `assignmentMessage(booking)` — "New assignment — VAgeWell Care /
      Service: X / Client: Name (phone) / Date: … / Note: …" — one place both call sites below build the
      exact same text from, so they can't drift.
- [x] **`web/src/components/ApproveAssignModal.tsx`**: confirming an assignment no longer just closes the
      modal — on success it swaps to a "Assigned to <name> — message them now" step with a **Message on
      WhatsApp** button (green, `wa.me` link, opens in a new tab) and a **Done** button to actually close.
      Uses the just-picked candidate's own `phone` (from the same `useAllProfiles` list already backing
      the assignee dropdown), not a stale/unrefetched `booking` prop.
- [x] **`web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**'s `BookingCard` gained a persistent **Message on WhatsApp**
      action (next to Review/Upload Report/View Report) whenever `assigned_to_phone` exists — covers
      re-sending later, not just the moment right after assigning, same as every other action on that
      card being available on demand rather than one-shot.
- Verified: `web` `tsc`/`eslint`/`next build --webpack` clean (17 routes); `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean
  (shared `types.ts`/`hooks.ts`/`phone.ts` touched, mobile unaffected — it doesn't render assignment
  actions). No DB migration — `profiles.phone` already existed and was already selectable.

## Change round — merged the web ops portal into the mobile app, then deleted `web/` (user, 2026-08-10)
User asked for "local caregiver for care seeker (clients) and caregiver (leaf node) and admin" — all
three roles — "in a single mobile app," with a reworked Skip/Next onboarding. Scoped via clarifying
questions: rework the existing onboarding carousel (not a login wizard or guest mode); genuinely retire
the web split, not just add mobile screens alongside it; core ops workflow first (not full 1:1 parity
with all 17 web routes — live sheet/CSV export, `/reports` table, `/team`, `/user-details` and
`/payment-qr` admin were intentionally left off mobile). Same day, user confirmed "now" to actually
delete `web/` once the mobile side worked, rather than leaving both around.

- [x] **`RootNavigator.tsx`** now routes by role into three shells sharing one Supabase session: admin →
      `AdminNavigator`, leaf_node → `CaregiverNavigator`, patient → the existing `AppNavigator`. Role
      picks the shell; RLS (unchanged) remains the actual access boundary in every case, same principle
      as every prior round in this log. The `CompleteProfileScreen` gate that used to block an ops
      account behind a client bio form is now dead code (unreferenced, not deleted) — it only existed
      because staff/admin used to land in the *client* tabs; they now get their own shell where those
      fields don't apply.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/navigation/OpsNavigator.tsx`** — `AdminNavigator` (Appointments, Requests,
      Clients, Team, Profile) and `CaregiverNavigator` (My Visits, Clients, Profile). No Requests/Team
      tabs for leaf_node: `booking_request_select` and `set_user_role()` are admin-only server-side, so
      those screens would only ever be empty/erroring for that role.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/screens/ops/*`** — direct ports of the web portal's core admin/caregiver pages,
      rebuilt as React Native screens against the same `shared/` hooks/mutations (no new backend surface):
      `AdminAppointmentsScreen` (search + date range, review payment, approve & assign, upload/view
      report, WhatsApp the caregiver — port of `/dashboard`), `AdminRequestsScreen` (port of
      `/requests`), `AdminTeamScreen` (caregiver roster + promote-by-search, port of `OpsMemberList` as
      used by `/leaf-nodes`), `MyVisitsScreen` (start → vitals → upload report → complete, port of
      `/my-visits`), `OpsClientsScreen` + `OpsClientDetailScreen` (client directory and one household's
      details/dependents/appointment history/reports-by-date, condensing `/patients` + its sub-routes),
      `OpsProfileScreen` (the signed-in ops account's own name/employee ID/photo/sign-out — phone and
      role are read-only, matching that promotion is never self-service).
- [x] **New `mobile/src/components/ops/*`** — `ApproveAssignModal`, `PaymentReviewModal`, `VitalsModal`,
      `ReportUploadModal` (RN ports of the matching `web/src/components/*.tsx`), plus `ProfilePhoto`
      (public-bucket avatar with the same `?v=<updated_at>` cache-bust `ProfileScreen` already used).
- [x] **New `mobile/src/lib/signedUrl.ts`** (`useSignedUrl` + `openUrl`) — every report/proof link is
      fetched up front and opened via `Linking.openURL`, never awaited inside a press handler. This app
      also ships as a web/PWA build via react-native-web, where `Linking.openURL` becomes `window.open`;
      awaiting a signed URL first severs the call from the user gesture and a popup blocker silently eats
      it — the exact bug this log's web side hit and fixed twice already (2026-07-31 rounds). Prefetching
      here means the mobile app can't reintroduce it.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/lib/reportFile.ts`**, backed by the newly added **`expo-document-picker`**
      dependency (`mobile/package.json`/`app.json`) — the only new package this round needed.
      `expo-image-picker` (already used for payment-proof/avatar uploads) can't return a PDF, and the web
      portal's report upload already accepts one (`ALLOWED_REPORT_MIME`); a caregiver uploading a lab
      report or prescription PDF is a normal case on mobile too, not something to silently drop.
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`** reworked: Skip now stays visible on every slide
      (including the last, so it's never a dead end); a **Back** button was added (absent on slide 1 so
      Next doesn't jump width when it appears on slide 2); the 4 dots are now individually tappable
      (jump straight to a slide, not just swipe-past); added a "1 of 4" step counter; and the 4 slides
      themselves now introduce all three roles (client booking, family, caregiver visits, admin
      oversight) instead of only the client booking journey — since the same onboarding is now the front
      door for everyone, not just clients. Verified in a real browser (Playwright against the exported
      web bundle): Next/Back/dot-jump/Skip all screenshotted working, zero console errors.
- [x] **`web/` deleted entirely** (all 17 routes, `AGENTS.md`'s "not the Next.js you know" notice
      included) — confirmed first that `mobile/`/`shared/` never referenced anything under `web/`
      (checked `package.json`s, `.env` files — none matched) and that its working tree had no
      uncommitted changes before removing it. `shared/src/export.ts`'s `liveSheetRows()` is now dead code
      (nothing in `mobile/` calls it — live sheet/CSV export wasn't in this round's mobile scope) but was
      left in place rather than stripped, matching this project's existing precedent for a
      superseded-but-harmless leftover (see 0017's/0024's dormant DB objects) rather than expanding this
      round's blast radius into `shared/`.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green (4.4 MB, 0 errors).
  **Not click-tested against a real backend** — the ops screens (approve & assign, payment review, vitals,
  report upload) all need a real OTP login against the live Supabase project to exercise, which this
  environment can't drive; only the pre-auth onboarding flow was live-verified. Worth a real click-through
  on a device as an admin and as a leaf_node before relying on this in production.
- **Not done, flagged not guessed:** no DB migration this round (pure frontend consolidation — every
  screen calls the same `shared/` hooks/mutations the web portal already used, RLS unchanged); any live
  deployment that used to point at `web/` (Vercel project, DNS, etc.) needs to be taken down separately —
  outside what this environment can see or touch.

## Change round — new Landing screen: Get Started / View as Guest / Staff or Admin sign-in (user, 2026-08-10)
Same-day follow-up: user wanted the front door to explicitly ask whether someone is a client or staff
(leaf_node/admin), not just silently route by role after login. Scoped via clarifying questions: the
choice lives on a new screen shown right after the onboarding slides (not folded into HomeScreen's
existing buttons), offering exactly two primary actions — "Get Started" and "View as Guest" — plus a
staff/admin entry point; and that staff/admin entry is **login-only, no self-signup** — caregiver/admin
accounts stay admin-promoted only (Team tab or founding-admin SQL), matching this project's original
principle before the now-deleted web portal's 2026-07-31 "self-select role" round explicitly accepted the
opposite trade-off for itself.

- [x] **New `mobile/src/screens/LandingScreen.tsx`.** Three doors: **Get Started** opens the existing
      client `AuthModal` (full Login/Sign up toggle, unchanged behavior); **View as Guest** skips straight
      to `HomeScreen`'s services/packages browsing (that screen's own "Get Started"/"Existing user —
      Login" buttons are still there if someone changes their mind mid-browse); **"Staff or Admin? Sign
      in"** opens a second `AuthModal` locked to login mode with no Sign-up tab. All three still funnel
      into the same phone+OTP gateway and the same post-login role-based routing in `RootNavigator` —
      this screen only picks which *form* someone sees, not what they're allowed to do; RLS is still the
      real boundary, unchanged.
- [x] **`AuthModal.tsx`** gained two optional props: `allowModeSwitch` (hides the Login/Sign-up toggle
      row entirely when false, used for the staff/admin entry) and `title` (overrides the default
      "Welcome back"/"Create your account" heading — used for "Staff / Admin sign in"). Both default to
      the prior behavior, so `HomeScreen`'s existing usage is unaffected.
- [x] **`RootNavigator.tsx`**: inserted between Onboarding and HomeScreen. Unlike `onboardingSeen`,
      `guestMode` is plain in-memory `useState`, not persisted to `AsyncStorage` — Landing is a chooser
      shown every time the app opens signed out, not a once-ever intro, so it reappears on a cold restart
      until the device actually signs in.
- [x] **Bugfix found while touching this code, fixed in passing:** `HomeScreen`'s shared `AuthModal`
      instance read its internal `mode` from `initialMode` only at first mount (React `useState` ignores
      later prop changes) — the modal itself never unmounts when `visible` flips to `false`, so on a cold
      HomeScreen, tapping "Existing user — Login" *before* ever tapping "Get Started" would have opened
      the modal still defaulted to the Sign-up tab. Fixed by keying that instance on `authMode` so it
      remounts fresh whenever the requested mode actually changes. `LandingScreen`'s two modals don't need
      this — each has a fixed `initialMode` for its whole lifetime, so there's no prop change to go stale
      against.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. Live-verified in a
  real browser (Playwright): Skip → Landing renders; "Staff or Admin? Sign in" opens a modal with **zero**
  "Sign up" tabs and the correct "Staff / Admin sign in" title; "Get Started" opens a modal with the
  Login/Sign-up toggle present; "View as Guest" lands on the unchanged HomeScreen content. Zero console
  errors across the whole run.
- **Not built, explicitly out of scope per the user's answer:** no role-mismatch message if a client's
  number is used through the staff door (or vice versa) — the account's real role decides the shell either
  way, so a "wrong door" attempt is harmless, just routes correctly regardless of which button was tapped.
  The now-deleted web portal did carry this kind of mismatch check; flagging here in case it's wanted back
  as a UX nicety, not because anything is unsafe without it.

## Change round — dark hero restyle of Onboarding/Landing + "Visit as" picker (user, 2026-08-10)
Same-day follow-up: user shared screenshots of a reference caregiver-marketplace app (localcaregiver.net)
— full-bleed photo onboarding slides, a "Visit as: Care Seeker / Caregiver" picker, gradient buttons — and
asked for that look. Scoped via clarifying questions before touching anything, since two parts of the
reference conflict with decisions this project has already made and reversed once: (1) **caregiver stays
admin-only** — the picker's "Caregiver" option was confirmed to route to the existing login-only door
(no self-signup), not grant a role the instant OTP verifies, which is exactly the trade-off the
now-deleted web portal's 2026-07-31 round accepted and this round does NOT repeat; (2) **no public job
feed** — the reference's guest-mode "Recent Jobs" list (browsable before login) was confirmed out of
scope; guest mode stays the existing services/packages browsing, since VAgeWell has no open-marketplace
data model (admin-approved booking + assignment, not caregivers browsing/messaging clients directly);
(3) **full visual match** was the one part approved as-is.

- [x] **New `mobile/src/components/feature/DarkHeroBackground.tsx`** — a full-bleed teal-to-near-black
      diagonal gradient plus a bottom-weighted darkening scrim, standing in for the reference's
      photograph. No licensed photography ships with this app, so rather than fabricate or source an
      image, this matches the *visual system* the photo was doing the job for (full-bleed backdrop,
      darkest where the headline/buttons sit) using `expo-linear-gradient` (already a dependency). Shared
      by both Onboarding and Landing so the two read as one continuous experience.
- [x] **New `GradientButton`/`TranslucentButton`** (`mobile/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`) — a
      diagonal teal→green gradient primary and a translucent-white-on-dark secondary, scoped
      *deliberately* to these hero screens only. The ordinary flat-teal `PrimaryButton`/`OutlineButton`
      used everywhere else in the app (Services, Payment, every ops screen, …) are untouched — this
      isn't a global re-theme, just new variants for the one context that needed them.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/components/feature/VisitAsModal.tsx`** — a bespoke dark rounded-card modal (not
      the shared white `AppModal` used by every other modal in the app, same "scoped, not global"
      reasoning as the buttons above), with two radio-style options: **Care Seeker** (pre-selected,
      matching the reference) and **Caregiver / Admin** (labelled with both roles, since this app's
      single login-only staff door already covers both — the reference only had one "Caregiver" concept
      to begin with). Continue only ever decides which *sign-in form* opens next; it creates nothing and
      assigns no role itself.
- [x] **`OnboardingScreen.tsx` restyled**, same interaction logic as before (Skip/Next/Back/tappable dots,
      the scroll-transition lock, `markOnboardingSeen()`), new look: `DarkHeroBackground` behind
      everything; small logo+wordmark top-left (no language-picker chip — the reference's is
      decorative-only in this app since there's no i18n system, and adding a dead dropdown would be a
      fake feature, not a restyle); each slide's title is now two-tone (a teal-highlighted phrase inside
      a white headline, e.g. "Care that **comes to you**"); Skip/dot-pager/Back/Next all moved into one
      bottom row on translucent dark circular buttons; the Next button swaps its icon to a checkmark on
      the last slide instead of turning into a differently-shaped "Get Started" pill, so the bottom row's
      layout stays identical across all 4 slides.
- [x] **`LandingScreen.tsx` restyled and restructured** — same `DarkHeroBackground` + logo lockup;
      **Get Started** now opens `VisitAsModal` first (was: straight to the client `AuthModal`) —
      Care Seeker → the existing full client Login/Sign-up modal, Caregiver/Admin → the existing
      login-only staff modal (both doors' underlying behavior is unchanged from the prior round, only
      how they're reached changed); **View as Guest** is unchanged; a new **"Already have account? Log
      In"** text link was added as a fast path straight into the client modal's login mode, bypassing the
      picker for the common case of a returning client. Both client-modal entry points now share one
      `clientAuthMode` state keyed onto the `AuthModal` instance (same stale-`initialMode` fix already
      applied to `HomeScreen`'s modal — see below).
- [x] **`AuthModal.tsx`** gained `allowModeSwitch`/`title` props in the prior round; unchanged this round
      — `VisitAsModal`'s Caregiver/Admin path reuses the exact same login-only configuration the
      standalone "Staff or Admin? Sign in" door used before, just reached through one extra step now.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. Live-verified in a
  real browser (Playwright, fresh context each run): onboarding slide 1 and slide 4 screenshotted (teal
  two-tone headline, checkmark on last slide, Back appears from slide 2 on); Landing screenshotted
  (gradient Get Started, translucent View as Guest, Log In link); tapping Get Started → Visit as modal
  screenshotted with Care Seeker pre-selected; selecting Caregiver / Admin → Continue opened the staff
  modal with the Sign-up tab confirmed absent (count 0), matching the admin-only decision above. Zero
  console errors across the whole run.
- **Not built, explicitly out of scope per the user's answers:** no self-service caregiver signup, no
  public browsable listings/jobs feed, no bottom tab bar in guest mode. Guest mode (`HomeScreen`) itself
  was not touched this round.

## Change round — removed the dev-only onboarding reset link (user, 2026-08-10)
User hit the same "onboarding not showing" confusion twice in one session — the cause both times was the
persisted per-device `vagewell.onboardingSeen` flag, not a bug (confirmed via a fresh-storage Playwright
run each time). A `process.env.NODE_ENV`-gated "Reset onboarding (dev)" link was added to `LandingScreen`
as a fix for the recurring friction, verified present in a `--dev` export and absent from the production
one. Same-day, user asked for it removed — the onboarding carousel's own Skip/Next is enough.

- [x] **Reverted in full**: `LandingScreen.tsx`'s `onResetOnboarding` prop and the link itself,
      `RootNavigator.tsx`'s `resetOnboarding` callback / `isDev` check / the prop wiring, and
      `lib/onboarding.ts`'s `resetOnboardingSeen()` helper — all deleted, not just hidden, since nothing
      else came to depend on them. `hasSeenOnboarding()`/`markOnboardingSeen()` are unchanged.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; confirmed no leftover references to `resetOnboardingSeen`,
  `onResetOnboarding`, or `isDev` anywhere in `src/`.
- **For the user, still true:** to see the onboarding carousel again after it's been dismissed once on a
  device, the `vagewell.onboardingSeen` flag has to be cleared manually — web: DevTools → Local Storage →
  delete the key → reload; Expo Go: no direct storage-clear in the dev menu, reinstall/clear the app's
  cache. No in-app affordance for this anymore, by request.

## Bugfix — Skip/Next unresponsive on a real Android phone (user, 2026-08-10)
Follow-up to the restyle: user reported Skip/Next "not working" on `OnboardingScreen`, tested via Expo Go
on an Android phone. Root-caused across two rounds, both confirmed with automated browser testing (a real
device isn't reachable from this environment) rather than guessed:

1. **First pass — missing `hitSlop`.** `HeroCircleButton` (the Next/Back control) was the only
   interactive element on the screen without one, unlike Skip (`hitSlop={8}`) and the dots
   (`hitSlop={10}`). Enlarged 48px → 56px and added `hitSlop={12}`. Confirmed via `react-native-web`'s
   own source (`node_modules/react-native-web/dist/exports/Pressable/index.js` — no `hitSlop` reference
   anywhere; it only exists in the legacy `Touchable` mixin, not `Pressable`, which this app uses
   throughout) that `hitSlop` is a *no-op on web* but works correctly on native — so this fix helps real
   devices specifically, even though it couldn't be verified in this environment's browser tests.
2. **Second pass, after the user confirmed it was still happening on Expo Go — edge clearance.** The
   bottom control row used `px-6` (24px) horizontal padding, putting Skip flush against the left screen
   edge and the Next circle flush against the right — both landing inside Android's system-wide
   edge-swipe-back gesture zone (Google's own Material guidance: keep interactive controls ≥24dp clear of
   the left/right edges; `px-6` sits exactly on that boundary, not clear of it). A tap that close to either
   edge can be consumed by the OS back-gesture recognizer before the app's touch responder ever sees it —
   consistent with *both* Skip (left) and Next (right) failing while the centered dot pager (unaffected by
   an edge report) was not mentioned as broken. Widened that row's horizontal padding to `px-10` (40px).
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. Live-verified with
  precise DOM-bounding-box clicks (not guessed coordinates) walking the full slide1→2→3→4→finish path
  after each fix, confirmed by dot-position and body-text checks at each step; screenshotted the new
  layout to confirm the extra padding didn't break slide 1's composition. Zero console errors throughout.
- **Not verifiable from this environment:** the actual fix's effect on a real Android phone — no
  device/emulator reachable here. Both changes are the standard, correct mitigations for their respective
  root causes (hitSlop for native touch forgiveness, edge clearance for Android's system gesture zone),
  not speculative tweaks — but confirmation still needs the user's own device.

## Bugfix #2 — user still reported Skip/Next unresponsive after both prior fixes; reverted to a full-width labeled button (user, 2026-08-10)
Two targeted patches (hitSlop, edge clearance) made no difference the user could observe. Rather than
keep guessing at a third variant of the same small-cornered-circle control, reverted to the interaction
pattern the very first, pre-restyle version of this screen used — a full-width, clearly labeled
"Next"/"Get Started" button — which was never once reported broken across the whole life of this project,
before or after any of the visual rounds. The small icon-only circle introduced by the dark-hero restyle
is the one variable that changed between "never reported broken" and "reported broken four times in a
row"; this round removes that variable entirely rather than continuing to patch around it.

- [x] **`OnboardingScreen.tsx` restructured**: Skip moved from the bottom-left corner back to the
      top-right corner (next to the logo, its original pre-restyle position — also never reported
      broken). The dot pager now sits alone on its own centered row, no longer sharing a row with any
      edge-adjacent control. The bottom row is now a full-width `GradientButton` (new, teal-gradient,
      built for the hero screens — see the prior restyle round) reading "Next" or "Get Started" with the
      arrow/check icon, taking up nearly the entire row width via `flex-1`; **Back** stays a small circle
      but now sits directly beside that large button rather than isolated alone in the far corner — even
      a near-miss on Back has a much larger, unambiguous sibling target immediately next to it. `goTo`/
      `goNext`/the transition-lock logic are all unchanged; this was a layout-only change.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. Live-verified the
  full path by clicking the actual "Next"/"Get Started" text labels (not guessed coordinates) through
  all 4 slides to Landing, plus Skip and Back — screenshotted at each step. Zero console errors.
- **Not verifiable from this environment, same caveat as bugfix #1:** confirmation on the user's actual
  Android device still hasn't happened — this round changes the interaction pattern, not just padding, on
  the theory that the small-circle design itself (not a fixable spacing/hitSlop detail of it) was the
  problem, which is the strongest lead available given the before/after pattern, but remains unconfirmed
  until the user tests it.

## Bugfix #3 — the real root cause: LinearGradient not inheriting pointerEvents="none" from its parent (user, 2026-08-10)
User reported the button redesign made no difference either — pressed for concrete diagnostic detail
this time rather than another guess: confirmed the **full-width** Get Started/View as Guest buttons on
`LandingScreen` were *also* completely dead, with **zero visual reaction** on tap (no press-opacity
flash, nothing). That ruled out every hit-target/edge-clearance theory from bugfixes #1–#2 outright — a
full-width button spanning nearly the whole screen can't be a "too small/too close to the edge" problem,
and "zero visual reaction" means the touch never reached the `Pressable` at all, on *any* button, on
*every* screen using the dark hero background. The one thing shared by every affected screen (Onboarding,
Landing) and never touched by prior fixes: `DarkHeroBackground`.

- [x] **Root cause**: `DarkHeroBackground`'s two full-bleed `LinearGradient` layers sat inside a wrapping
      `View` with `pointerEvents="none"`, relying on that to cascade down to the gradients. `LinearGradient`
      (`expo-linear-gradient`) renders its own native view — a custom Android drawing surface, not a plain
      RN `View` — and a parent's `pointerEvents="none"` (a JS-level convenience RN compiles into a
      touch-handling flag per native view) does not reliably propagate into a third-party native
      component's own view the same way it does into a nested plain `View`. Left unset on the gradient
      itself, it could end up the frontmost thing Android's touch dispatcher sees over the buttons sitting
      visually on top of it, silently absorbing every tap with no feedback — matching the reported symptom
      exactly. This is a native-only failure mode: `react-native-web`'s gradient fallback is a plain CSS
      `<div>` with standard `pointer-events` semantics, which is why every round of browser-based testing
      in this session passed cleanly while the real device kept failing.
- [x] **Fix**: `pointerEvents="none"` added directly to **each** `<LinearGradient>` element in
      `DarkHeroBackground.tsx`, not only the wrapping `View` (kept as belt-and-braces). Three-line change,
      no layout/visual difference — this is a touch-routing fix, not a restyle.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean (confirms `LinearGradient` accepts `pointerEvents`, inherited
  from `ViewProps`); `expo export --platform web` bundle green; full click-through smoke test (Skip →
  Landing → Get Started → Visit-as modal) still passes with zero console errors — expected, since this
  fix targets a native-only symptom the web build never exhibited in the first place.
- **Not verifiable from this environment, same caveat as bugfixes #1–#2**: no Android device/emulator
  reachable here. Unlike the prior two rounds, this fix targets a mechanism (native pointerEvents
  inheritance into a third-party view) that plausibly explains *all* of this session's reports at once —
  every screen, every button, zero visual feedback — rather than one narrow slice of them, which is why
  it's the strongest candidate so far. Still needs the user's own device to confirm.

## Change round — reverted Onboarding's bottom row back to the corner-circle layout (user, 2026-08-10)
User re-shared the same localcaregiver.net reference screenshot (Skip bottom-left, dots centered, a
small circular Next arrow bottom-right) and asked for the carousel to match it — i.e., undo bugfix #2's
full-width "Next"/"Get Started" button. That change had been a defensive guess made *before* the real
root cause (bugfix #3: `DarkHeroBackground`'s `LinearGradient` layers not inheriting `pointerEvents="none"`)
was found — now that the actual bug is fixed at its source, the button shape/size was never the problem,
so it's safe to go back to the layout the user actually wants.

- [x] **`OnboardingScreen.tsx`**: bottom row reverted to Skip (left) + dot pager (center) + Back/Next
      circle cluster (right) in one row, matching the reference exactly; Skip moved back off the top
      corner. Kept every hardening change from bugfixes #1–#2 that doesn't fight the reference layout:
      `HeroCircleButton` stays at 56px with `hitSlop={12}` (real tap-forgiveness on native, inert but
      harmless on web), and the row keeps `px-10` (40px) horizontal padding instead of the original
      `px-6` (Android's edge-swipe-back gesture zone guidance — cheap insurance even though it likely
      wasn't the actual cause of any of this). `GradientButton`'s unused import removed from this file
      (still used by `LandingScreen`, which keeps its own full-width buttons — that screen's reference
      screenshot always showed full-width pills, so it was never changed).
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green; full click-through
  (precise DOM-bounding-box clicks) through all 4 slides to Landing, screenshotted slide 1 to confirm the
  layout visually matches the reference. Zero console errors.
- **Still the same standing caveat**: none of this session's fixes have been confirmed against the user's
  actual Android device yet. The pointerEvents fix (bugfix #3) is the one that should matter most; this
  round is purely a layout preference once that fix made the button-shape question moot.

## Change round — re-added the dev-only onboarding reset link (removed two rounds ago, user, 2026-08-10)
Follow-up diagnostic confirmed the app was going straight to the "Get Started" Landing screen on every
launch — which only happens when `vagewell.onboardingSeen` is already `true`, i.e. the device successfully
completed onboarding at some point (most likely evidence the touch-fix chain actually worked, since that
flag only gets set from a real Skip/Next tap reaching `finish()`). With no in-app way left to clear it
(removed earlier this session at the user's request) a full Expo Go uninstall/reinstall was the only
option, which was clearly too much friction for the iterative testing this conversation had been doing —
asked directly whether to restore the dev-only reset link, and the user confirmed.

- [x] **Reinstated exactly as it was before removal**: `lib/onboarding.ts`'s `resetOnboardingSeen()`,
      `RootNavigator.tsx`'s `isDev` check (`process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`, not React Native's
      untyped `__DEV__`) and `resetOnboarding` callback, and `LandingScreen.tsx`'s `onResetOnboarding` prop
      + small "Reset onboarding (dev)" link.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; built both `expo export --platform web --dev` and the plain
  production export side-by-side — confirmed via Playwright the link is present and functionally resets
  back to slide 1 in the dev bundle, and completely absent from the production bundle. Zero non-WebSocket
  console errors in both (the dev bundle's WebSocket errors are expected — it's trying to reach Metro's
  HMR server, which isn't running against a static file server).
- **For the user:** tap "Reset onboarding (dev)" at the bottom of the Landing screen any time you want to
  see the 4-slide carousel again during testing — no reinstall needed. It will never appear in a real
  production build.

## Change round — onboarding is no longer "once per device"; shows on every app open, for every user (user, 2026-08-10)
Confirmed the app was landing straight on "Get Started" every time (per the previous round's diagnostic),
and asked directly whether the user actually wants the carousel to show once per device (as it always
had) or every single time the app opens, for every real user — not just during testing. The user chose
the latter: **always**, unconditionally.

This removes the entire persistence layer behind the earlier confusion, not just the symptom — with
onboarding no longer tracked as "seen," there's nothing left to get stuck, nothing left to reset, and no
more dev-only escape hatch needed at all.

- [x] **Deleted `mobile/src/lib/onboarding.ts` entirely** (`hasSeenOnboarding`/`markOnboardingSeen`/
      `resetOnboardingSeen`, the whole `AsyncStorage`-backed module) — confirmed via repo-wide grep that
      nothing else referenced any of its exports before removing it.
- [x] **`RootNavigator.tsx`** rewritten: `onboardingSeen` (a `boolean | null` fed by an async
      `AsyncStorage` read, gating an extra `SplashScreen` flash while it loaded) replaced by
      `onboardingDone`, a plain synchronous `useState(false)` — no `useEffect`, no async gate. A fresh
      cold start creates a fresh `RootNavigator` instance with this back at `false`, which is exactly what
      "every time the app opens" means; no storage read/write required to achieve it.
- [x] **`OnboardingScreen.tsx`**: `finish()` no longer calls `markOnboardingSeen()` — it only calls the
      `onDone` prop now, which is purely in-memory routing state owned by `RootNavigator`, not a
      persisted fact about the device.
- [x] **`LandingScreen.tsx`**: `onResetOnboarding` prop and the "Reset onboarding (dev)" link removed —
      meaningless now that there's nothing to reset. Doc comment updated to state plainly that neither
      screen persists anything anymore.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean. Live-verified with Playwright, including the one check that
  actually matters for "every time the app opens": loaded fresh (slide 1 visible), clicked through Skip to
  Landing, confirmed **zero** `localStorage` keys at any point, confirmed the reset link is gone entirely,
  then did a full `page.reload()` (the closest a browser test can get to simulating a cold app restart)
  and confirmed slide 1 reappeared automatically — no button, no flag, no persistence anywhere in the path.
  Zero console errors.
- **Product-behavior note, stated plainly since this is a real change from how onboarding intros usually
  work:** every single person who opens this app, every single time, including a returning client on
  their tenth visit, will now see the 4-slide carousel before reaching Get Started. This was an explicit,
  direct choice, not a default — flagging here in case it's worth revisiting once the immediate testing
  need that drove today's back-and-forth has passed.

## Root cause of the entire "stale build" saga — a Metro dev server left running since before several fixes
User's testing finally produced a desktop-browser screenshot showing the app working correctly (Landing,
no dev-reset text, the auth modal opening properly) — confirming the fix. Investigated why phone testing
kept showing stale content through every prior fix in this session despite full Expo Go closes/reopens and
`expo start -c`: `netstat` found an active process already bound to port 8081 (Metro's default port),
independent of anything this session's `expo export`-based verification builds ever touched. Almost
certainly a Metro instance the user had left running continuously across the whole session — Metro's
incremental Fast Refresh can fail to cleanly drop a **deleted** file from its module graph (this session
deleted `lib/onboarding.ts` twice), which would explain a stale bundle surviving every phone-side reset
that never touches the *server* itself. Killed the process (`taskkill //F //PID 8876`); confirmed port 8081
free afterward. This is almost certainly the true root cause behind bugfixes #1–#3 all reading as "no
effect" from the user's side even though each was independently verified correct in isolation — the phone
was very plausibly never running any of that code at all until the server itself restarted clean.

## Change round — "Already have account? Log In" now also asks Care Seeker vs Caregiver·Admin (user, 2026-08-10)
Once the stale-build mystery was resolved, user pointed out a real, remaining product gap visible in the
now-correctly-loading app: "Log In" skipped the Visit-as picker entirely and went straight to the client
login form — meaning a returning caregiver or admin tapping the more natural "Already have account? Log
In" link (rather than "Get Started") would land in the wrong form with no way to reach their own login
door from there.

- [x] **`LandingScreen.tsx`**: both "Get Started" and "Already have account? Log In" now open the same
      `VisitAsModal`, via a new `openVisitAs(intent)` helper that remembers which of `"register"`/`"login"`
      the **Care Seeker** path should open as once chosen — `visitAsIntent` state, read only by
      `handleVisitAs`'s `care_seeker` branch. The **Caregiver · Admin** path is unaffected by intent
      either way — it's already login-only regardless of which button opened the picker, matching the
      standing "no caregiver self-signup" decision from earlier in this session.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. Live-verified: Log In
  → Visit as (picker shown, not skipped) → Care Seeker (pre-selected) → Continue → opens `AuthModal`
  titled "Welcome back" (login mode, not "Create your account") with the Login/Sign-up toggle still
  present; separately, Log In → Caregiver / Admin → Continue → opens the same login-only staff modal as
  before, Sign-up tab confirmed absent. Screenshotted the login-mode modal to confirm visually. Zero
  console errors.

## Change round — booking flow: end date instead of day count, no payment-method step, no amount shown (user, 2026-08-21)
User: "the price line should be bold and then add start date and end date from the customer itself remove
number of date and remove the calculation fo the amount after the treatment the care assistant or admin
share the price amount then the cusotmer have to pay it." Confirmed via two clarifying questions: the
"Payment method" step (Online UPI/QR/screenshot vs Pay at Visit) is removed entirely — booking is just
confirmed after picking service + dates ("Remove it — booking is just confirmed"); and the
`pricing_model` (per_day/flat_advance) distinction no longer branches any booking-flow UI — all 4 services
become plain start/end-date bookings ("No — drop it").

**No DB migration this round** — `bookings.num_days` (existing column, bounded 1–60) is still what's
persisted; the new End date field is purely a friendlier client-side input that gets converted to
`num_days` before submit (`daysBetween(start, end)`, new in `shared/src/dates.ts`), so the existing
`tg_booking_snapshot()` trigger and its `total_amount` computation are untouched. Scoped deliberately:
this round removes the amount/payment-method step from what the **customer** sees at booking time: the
DB's own `total_amount` bookkeeping and every admin-side amount display (dashboard cards, live sheet,
WhatsApp assignment message) are left as they are — a real DB/admin-workflow change wasn't asked for and
wasn't in scope of "remove the calculation of the amount" in the context this was raised (the customer's
booking screens).

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/AppointmentScreen.tsx`**: the "Number of days"/"Number of months" `FormInput`
      replaced with an "End date" `DateField` (picking a later start date now bumps a stale end date
      forward automatically). The whole pricing-summary purple box (advance/per-day math, total) is gone,
      replaced by a plain note: "No payment is collected now. Our care assistant or admin will share the
      charges after your visit." The Service dropdown's options now show just the service name — no
      price/pricing-model suffix. `submit()` validates `end_date >= start_date` and the resulting range
      is within `MAX_BOOKING_DAYS` (60, unchanged DB bound) before deriving `num_days` and continuing.
- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/PaymentScreen.tsx` rewritten into a plain review-and-confirm step** (kept the
      same route name/position in the stack — still Appointment → Payment — since a review step before
      the actual insert is still good UX, just with no payment-method choice on it anymore). Removed
      entirely: the Online UPI / Pay at Visit `MethodCard` pair, the QR code display + screenshot
      `ImagePickerField` + upload logic, and the "Total payable" row. `confirm()` now inserts the booking
      directly with a fixed `payment_method: "direct"` (no method was ever chosen) and no proof-upload
      step. The success screen's body message was reworded to say the team will share charges after the
      visit and payment happens directly with the care staff then.
- [x] **`mobile/src/components/ops/NewAppointmentModal.tsx`** (admin/leaf_node booking on a caller's
      behalf) — same treatment: day-count field → End date `DateField`, service dropdown loses its price
      suffix, the "Pay at Visit ₹<total>" footer row lost its computed amount (kept as a plain "no
      payment collected now" note) since there's no longer a total to show at this step either.
- [x] **`mobile/src/navigation/types.ts`**: `BookingDraft` dropped `price_per_day`/`pricing_model`
      (nothing needs them anymore) and gained `end_date: string` (the raw customer-entered value, shown
      as-is on the confirm screen and the success summary — it's always internally consistent with
      `num_days` since the latter is derived from it via `daysBetween`, never entered independently).
- [x] **New `daysBetween(startISO, endISO)`** (`shared/src/dates.ts`) — inclusive day count between two
      "YYYY-MM-DD" strings, parsed as local dates (not `new Date(iso)`, which parses as UTC and can land
      on the wrong calendar day once shifted to the device's zone — the same class of bug this project's
      `formatDate`/`addDays` already guard against). Both `AppointmentScreen.tsx` and
      `NewAppointmentModal.tsx` gained a small local `parseISODate()` for the same reason, used only for
      the End date field's `minimumDate`.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors); `expo export --platform web` bundle green (2923
  modules). Live-verified the unauthenticated path (onboarding → Landing → Guest → Home) with Playwright,
  zero console errors — confirms the bundle itself is healthy after these changes. **Not click-tested**
  past sign-in: `AppointmentScreen`/`PaymentScreen`/`NewAppointmentModal` all require a real OTP login
  against the live Supabase project to exercise the actual booking submit, which this environment can't
  drive — worth a real click-through (pick service → set start/end date → confirm → check the booking
  lands with the right `num_days` and no payment fields) on the user's own device/build before relying on
  this in production.

## Change round — drop Apple sign-in; Google sign-in now still requires phone+OTP (user, 2026-08-21)
User asked to remove "Continue with Apple" (Google alone is enough). Since "Continue with Google"
currently signs someone in completely on its own — no phone, no OTP at all — asked a clarifying question
about what should happen to that gap; user chose the higher-commitment option: **Google can still create
the account immediately, but the account is then blocked behind a mandatory phone+OTP verification gate**
before it can use the rest of the app (mirrors the existing `CompleteProfileScreen` gate pattern for
web-registered ops accounts). This restores this project's original "phone+OTP is required, no exceptions"
principle even for the one auth path that had quietly bypassed it.

- [x] **New migration `0031_phone_verification_sync.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header
      bumped to "0001–0031"): a Google identity never has a phone (`auth.users.phone` stays null), and
      `handle_new_user()` only fires on account **creation** — nothing kept `profiles.phone` (client-
      unwritable by design, same as at signup) in sync with a *later* phone-change, and nothing ran the
      `family_members`/`patient_leads` auto-link matching for that case either. New `security definer`
      trigger `handle_user_phone_verified()` (`after update of phone on auth.users`, fires only
      `old.phone is null and new.phone is not null`) mirrors `handle_new_user()`'s own logic exactly:
      sets `profiles.phone`, then runs the same "first unclaimed match wins" household/lead linking.
- [x] **New `mobile/src/screens/VerifyPhoneScreen.tsx`** — phone + OTP, two-step (mirrors `AuthModal`'s
      own details→otp shape), but uses Supabase's **phone-change** flow since the account is already
      authenticated: `auth.updateUser({ phone })` (sends the OTP) then
      `auth.verifyOtp({ phone, token, type: "phone_change" })` (confirms it) — not the sign-up OTP flow.
      On success, `refreshProfile()` re-fetches the row the 0031 trigger just updated, which is what lets
      the gate below clear. Includes a **Sign out** escape hatch (same reasoning as
      `CompleteProfileScreen`'s) since this is a hard block.
- [x] **`RootNavigator.tsx`**: new `if (profile && !profile.phone) return <VerifyPhoneScreen />;`,
      checked right after the `!user` branch and before role-based shell routing — applies to *any*
      account with no phone (today, only ever reachable via Google), not just a specific role.
- [x] **`AuthModal.tsx`**: removed the "Continue with Apple" button entirely (kept "Continue with
      Google"); doc comments updated to state the new gate explicitly — Google is "a convenience on top
      of [phone verification], never a way around it." **`lib/oauth.ts`**: `OAuthProvider` narrowed from
      `"google" | "apple"` to just `"google"`. `AppleIcon` (`components/ui/SocialIcons.tsx`) is now
      unreferenced but left in place, same precedent as this project's other dormant-but-harmless
      leftovers — cheap to bring back if Apple sign-in is ever wanted again. Removed the now-unused
      `auth.continueWithApple` translation key.
- [x] **New `verifyPhone.*` translation namespace** (`translations/verifyPhone.ts`, registered in
      `translations/index.ts`) — the screen also reuses several existing `auth.*` keys directly
      (mobile number label/placeholder, OTP entry copy, resend timer, change-number link) rather than
      duplicating them.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. Live-verified with
  Playwright: the Sign-up modal now shows only "Continue with Google" (Apple confirmed absent, 0 matches),
  full name/mobile-number fields and Send OTP unaffected, zero console errors. **Not click-tested end to
  end** — actually completing a Google OAuth sign-in and landing on `VerifyPhoneScreen` needs a real
  Google account + a live redirect round-trip, which this environment can't drive; the gate's *logic* was
  verified by reading the code path (RootNavigator's new check, the DB trigger's exact mirror of
  `handle_new_user()`), not by an actual click-through.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0031_phone_verification_sync.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment — until
  it does, `profiles.phone` won't sync after a phone-change verification, and `VerifyPhoneScreen` would
  loop (the gate would never clear even after a successful OTP verify).
- **Confirmed working, same day:** user finished the Google Cloud OAuth Client setup (Branding, Clients,
  redirect URI) and pasted the Client ID/Secret into Supabase's Google provider. Hit two more config gaps
  along the way, both fixed on the Supabase Dashboard side, not in code: (1) `redirect_uri_mismatch` —
  the registered Google redirect URI didn't byte-for-byte match Supabase's callback URL; fixed by copying
  it directly from Supabase's Google provider panel instead of retyping; (2) after picking a Google
  account, the app looped back to the language-picker screen — root cause was Supabase's own
  **Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs** allowlist being completely empty, so Supabase
  silently dropped the session instead of attaching it to the return redirect (a separate setting from
  Google's own redirect URI, easy to miss). Fixed by adding both `http://localhost:8081/*` and the bare
  `http://localhost:8081` (covers Supabase's exact-origin redirect request, which the wildcard alone may
  not match) to Redirect URLs, and setting Site URL to match. Google sign-in confirmed working end to end
  after this — first real click-through confirmation of the whole `AuthModal`/`VerifyPhoneScreen` chain
  this session.

## Change round — business-hours restriction removed from appointment time picking (user, 2026-08-21)
User saw the "Pick a time between 06:00 AM and 09:00 PM" red warning on the Appointment form (picking
05:00 AM triggered it) and asked for it gone. Confirmed via a clarifying question this meant removing the
restriction entirely (any time of day bookable), not just tightening the picker to only offer valid hours.

- [x] **New migration `0032_remove_time_slot_business_hours.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`,
      header bumped to "0001–0032", plus the fresh-install `CREATE TABLE` inline CHECK updated too):
      `bookings.time_slot`'s CHECK constraint dropped the `time_slot between '06:00' and '21:00'` clause
      entirely. Kept the 15-minute-boundary requirement (`extract(minute from time_slot) in
      (0,15,30,45)`) — the picker itself only ever offers `:00/:15/:30/:45` minutes, so that part was
      never really a "business hours" restriction, just a scheduling granularity one.
- [x] **`shared/src/format.ts`**: `timeSlots()` now generates all 24 hours (was `BOOKING_START_HOUR`
      through `BOOKING_END_HOUR`, i.e. 06:00–21:00). **`shared/src/constants.ts`**: `BOOKING_START_HOUR`/
      `BOOKING_END_HOUR` deleted (no longer meaningful — nothing else referenced them, confirmed via
      `tsc`).
- [x] **`mobile/src/components/ui/TimeField.tsx`**: removed the `validSet`/business-hours check entirely
      — the hour/minute/AM-PM picker now always calls `onChange` with whatever combination is selected,
      no red "Pick a time between…" warning possible anymore (the `useMemo`/`timeSlots()` import that
      built that validation set is gone too). The field's `error` prop (parent-supplied, e.g. a required-
      field message) is untouched — this only removed the component's own internal range check.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors, confirms no other file referenced the deleted
  constants); `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Not click-tested** — exercising the Appointment
  form's time picker needs a signed-in session (now working, per the Google sign-in confirmation above,
  but not re-tested for this specific change) — worth picking an early-morning or late-night time on the
  user's own device to confirm no red warning appears and the booking submits successfully.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0032_remove_time_slot_business_hours.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this
  environment — until it does, the database will still reject a booking outside 06:00–21:00 even though
  the app no longer blocks picking one, producing a confusing insert-time error instead of the removed
  inline warning.

## Confirmed — Google sign-in works end to end; VerifyPhoneScreen gains a Name field (user, 2026-08-21)
User finished the Google OAuth setup for real this time: the root cause of the persistent "Unable to
exchange external code" error (`unexpected_failure` on the redirect) turned out to be a **disabled**
Client Secret still sitting in Supabase's Google provider settings — the Google Cloud client had two
secrets, the original (created 2026-08-18) had gone `Disabled` at some point, and Supabase was still
configured with that one. Root-caused by walking through Google Cloud Console's Client detail page
(Client secrets section shows Status per secret) rather than guessing further at redirect-URI theories.
Generating a fresh secret and pasting the **full** value (only ever shown once, at creation) into
Supabase fixed it — confirmed by an actual successful sign-in landing on `VerifyPhoneScreen`, verifying a
real phone, and reaching the normal Profile tab with the Google-derived name ("Maheshwari Suresh")
already populated.

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/VerifyPhoneScreen.tsx`** gained a **Full Name** field, shown above Mobile
      Number on the same step — pre-filled from `profile.full_name` (whatever Google's OAuth response
      populated it with, via `handle_new_user()`'s existing `raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name'` read, no
      DB change needed since Google already supplies this claim). Editable before continuing, since a
      Google-derived name isn't always what someone wants to go by. Saved via the existing
      `useUpdateProfile()` mutation the moment "Send OTP" is tapped (only if actually changed from what's
      already stored) — independent of whether the phone/OTP step itself succeeds, so a retried phone
      verification doesn't discard an edited name. Reused `auth.fullName`/`auth.namePlaceholder`/
      `auth.error.enterName` translation keys already defined for `AuthModal`'s own name field, rather
      than duplicating them under `verifyPhone.*`.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Confirmed working
  by the user directly** (not just this session's own testing) — first real end-to-end click-through of
  the whole Google sign-in → phone verification → normal shell chain, screenshotted from the actual
  Profile tab showing the verified phone number and Google-derived name.

## Change round — service card polish: green box sizing, Physio icon, Para-Medical wording (user, 2026-08-22)
Three small visual/content fixes off a screenshot.

- [x] **Green "starts from ₹X" box now matches the service cards' padding** — was `px-4 py-2.5` (shorter
      than the white cards above it), now plain `p-4` (same as `Card`'s own padding), in both
      `HomeScreen.tsx` and `ServicesScreen.tsx`.
- [x] **Physio Therapy's icon changed** from `Dumbbell` to `Activity` (a pulse/heartbeat-style icon) in
      `mobile/src/lib/serviceIcon.ts`'s `iconForService()` lookup — this only affects the **signed-in**
      Services tab (`ServicesScreen.tsx`); the guest Home screen has always shown a fixed `Stethoscope`
      for every card regardless of service, unrelated to this lookup, so it wasn't touched.
- [x] **Para-Medical's first bullet reworded** from generic "Vital monitoring" to "Vital tracking (BP,
      Sugar, SpO2)" — mirrors the summary line's own parenthetical detail, matching what the user called
      "point 1." Updated everywhere the exact string must match byte-for-byte: `SEED_SERVICES`
      (`shared/src/constants.ts`), `services.ts` translations (en + ta), `serviceI18n.ts`'s
      `DESCRIPTION_KEYS` lookup, and both `supabase/seed.sql` and `install_all.sql`'s seed INSERT. New
      migration `0033_para_medical_bullet_wording.sql` (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0033") updates the live row directly via `UPDATE ... WHERE name = 'Para-Medical'` — separate
      from the seed INSERT's own `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, which would also fix it on a full re-run, but a
      standalone migration matches this project's established one-change-one-migration precedent.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green; live-verified the
  guest Home screen with Playwright — Para-Medical's bullet list confirmed reading "Vital tracking (BP,
  Sugar, SpO2)" first, green box screenshotted at the new taller padding, zero console errors. **Physio
  icon not visually verified** — needs the signed-in Services tab, which requires a real login this
  environment can't perform.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0033_para_medical_bullet_wording.sql` (or
  the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment —
  until it does, the live database still shows the old "Vital monitoring" wording even though the app's
  own bundled fallback text (used before a fresh fetch, and on the guest Home screen) already reads the
  new wording.

## Change round — single-box time picker, dropped the slots note, Para-Medical SpO2 → O2 (user, 2026-08-22)
Three more small fixes off a screenshot of the Appointment form.

- [x] **`mobile/src/components/ui/TimeField.tsx` collapsed to one dropdown.** Was a hour `SelectSheet` +
      minute `SelectSheet` + AM/PM `ChoiceChips` (three separate controls reading, per the user, like
      "two timings"); now a single `SelectSheet` populated straight from `timeSlots()` (e.g. "06:00 AM"
      as one option) — same 15-minute-across-the-full-day list already used elsewhere, still always emits
      a valid `"HH:MM"`. Delegates its `label`/`error` rendering to `SelectSheet` itself rather than
      duplicating that markup, so the component shrank to a thin wrapper.
- [x] **Removed the "Slots are recorded as requested; availability is confirmed by our team." note**
      (with its `Info` icon) from the bottom of `AppointmentScreen.tsx` — dropped the now-unused `Info`
      import and the `appointment.slotsNote` translation key (English + Tamil), confirmed unused
      elsewhere first.
- [x] **Para-Medical's "SpO2" simplified to "O2"** in both the summary line and the first bullet ("Vital
      tracking (BP, Sugar, O2)") — updated everywhere the exact string must match byte-for-byte:
      `SEED_SERVICES` (`shared/src/constants.ts`), `services.ts` translations (en + ta, including the
      Tamil parenthetical which keeps this abbreviation untranslated same as before), `serviceI18n.ts`'s
      `DESCRIPTION_KEYS` lookup, and both `supabase/seed.sql` and `install_all.sql`'s seed INSERT.
      **Deliberately left untouched:** `modals/vitals.ts`'s own "SpO2" — that's the staff-facing vitals-
      entry form's field label for a real clinical measurement, a different concept from this marketing
      description text, not something this request was about.
- [x] **New migration `0034_para_medical_o2_wording.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header
      bumped to "0001–0034") — same `UPDATE ... WHERE name = 'Para-Medical'` pattern as 0033, applied on
      top of it (0033's "Vital tracking (BP, Sugar, SpO2)" wording → this round's "...O2)").
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green; live-verified with
  Playwright — guest Home screen confirmed showing "Vital tracking (BP, Sugar, O2)" with zero remaining
  "SpO2" anywhere on the page, zero console errors. **Not visually verified:** the single-box time picker
  and the removed slots note both live on `AppointmentScreen.tsx`, which needs a signed-in session this
  environment can't reach — worth a quick look on the user's device.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0034_para_medical_o2_wording.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment.

## Bugfix — removed a price leak the "no payment at booking" round missed on My Appointments (user, 2026-08-22)
User's own screenshot of "My Appointments" showed a computed `₹800` still displayed on a missed booking
card, contradicting the whole "no payment shown/collected at booking time — the care assistant/admin
shares it after the visit" change from earlier this session. Root cause: that round only scoped the fix to
the **booking-time** screens (`AppointmentScreen`/`PaymentScreen`), deliberately leaving `total_amount`
displays alone on the theory they were admin bookkeeping — but `PatientBookingCard.tsx` and
`DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `MissedAppointment`/`LastCompletedCheckup` cards are the **patient's own**
"My Appointments" list, not an admin screen. The DB trigger still computes `total_amount` server-side
(unchanged, still useful for the genuinely admin-facing ops screens), but showing that number back to the
patient before any admin has actually communicated it is exactly the leak the user is pointing at.

- [x] **Removed the `money(booking.total_amount)` line** from `PatientBookingCard.tsx` (every active
      booking card) and from `DashboardScreen.tsx`'s `LastCompletedCheckup` and `MissedAppointment` cards
      — all three now show just the status pill(s) (Pay at Visit / Requested / You missed it / etc.), no
      amount. Dropped the now-unused `money` import from both files.
- [x] **Confirmed via a repo-wide grep that every remaining `total_amount`/`money()` reference lives under
      `mobile/src/screens/ops/*` or `mobile/src/components/ops/*`** — the genuinely admin/leaf_node-facing
      screens, which were always the intended scope for keeping amount tracking. `ProfileScreen.tsx`'s
      Checkup history also checked clean (never showed an amount).
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Not visually
  verified** — both affected components only render on the signed-in Appointments tab, which needs a real
  login this environment can't reach; the fix is a straightforward line removal confirmed by the clean
  typecheck. Worth a look on the user's device to confirm the missed/upcoming/completed cards no longer
  show any ₹ amount.

## Bugfix — "My Appointments" upcoming list wasn't in date order after a reschedule (user, 2026-08-22)
User's screenshot: after rescheduling, a booking dated Aug 28 showed above one dated Aug 24 — not
chronological. Root cause: `useMyBookings()` (`shared/src/hooks.ts`) orders its query by `created_at desc`
(newest-*booked*-first) — the right order for the "recently missed"/"last completed" nudges, which already
had their own explicit `start_date`-descending `.sort()` on top of it, but `DashboardScreen.tsx`'s
`active` (upcoming) list had **no sort of its own at all** — it just inherited the raw creation-time
order. A reschedule creates its replacement booking *after* the original, so the newer booking (whatever
date it's actually scheduled for) always sorted above an older-created one, even when the older one's
appointment date was sooner.

- [x] **`DashboardScreen.tsx`**: the `active` list now sorts by `start_date` ascending (soonest
      appointment first), with `time_slot` ascending as a tiebreaker for same-day bookings — computed
      once inside the existing `useMemo`, right alongside the `missed`/`completed` sorts that were already
      there.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Not visually
  verified** — needs a signed-in session with multiple real bookings to see the reordering, which this
  environment can't set up; the fix is a straightforward added `.sort()` confirmed by the clean typecheck.

## Change round — Para-Medical: "tracking" → "Monitoring" (user, 2026-08-22)
User's screenshot still showed the pre-migration wording ("SpO2"/"Vital monitoring") — confirmed via grep
that every app-code and current-SQL-seed file already had the 0033/0034 wording; the screenshot was simply
the still-not-yet-migrated live database (expected, flagged each round). Alongside that, a genuinely new
wording change: "tracking" → "Monitoring" in both the summary line and the first bullet.

- [x] Summary line: "Vitals tracking (BP, Sugar, O2)" → **"Vitals Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2)"**. First
      bullet: "Vital tracking (BP, Sugar, O2)" → **"Vital Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2)"**. Updated everywhere
      the exact string must match byte-for-byte: `SEED_SERVICES` (`shared/src/constants.ts`),
      `services.ts` translations (English only — the existing Tamil already used "கண்காணிப்பு", which
      already means "monitoring," so no Tamil wording actually changed), `serviceI18n.ts`'s
      `DESCRIPTION_KEYS` lookup, and both `supabase/seed.sql` and `install_all.sql`'s seed INSERT.
- [x] **New migration `0035_para_medical_monitoring_wording.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`,
      header bumped to "0001–0035") — same `UPDATE ... WHERE name = 'Para-Medical'` pattern as 0033/0034,
      applied on top of both.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green; live-verified with
  Playwright — guest Home screen confirmed showing both "Vitals Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2)" and "Vital
  Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2)", zero remaining "SpO2" or old-cased "Vital monitoring" anywhere on the page,
  zero console errors.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0035_para_medical_monitoring_wording.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this
  environment — until it (and the still-outstanding 0033/0034 before it) runs, the live database keeps
  showing the pre-this-session wording the user's screenshot captured.

## Change round — Para-Medical: split "(BP, Sugar, O2)" off the summary line onto the bullet only (user, 2026-08-22)
Follow-up: the parenthetical detail was duplicated across both the summary and the first bullet. User
asked for the summary line plain, and the detail to live only on the bullet.

- [x] Summary: "Vitals Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2) and medication compliance." → **"Vitals Monitoring and
      medication compliance."** (parenthetical dropped). First bullet: **"Vitals Monitoring (BP, Sugar,
      O2)"** (was "Vital Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2)" — plural "Vitals" now used consistently with the
      summary, matching the user's own phrasing). Updated everywhere the exact string must match
      byte-for-byte: `SEED_SERVICES` (`shared/src/constants.ts`), `services.ts` translations (English +
      Tamil — Tamil's summary also dropped its own parenthetical, keeping it only on the bullet),
      `serviceI18n.ts`'s `DESCRIPTION_KEYS` lookup, and both `supabase/seed.sql` and `install_all.sql`'s
      seed INSERT.
- [x] **New migration `0036_para_medical_split_bp_sugar_o2.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`,
      header bumped to "0001–0036") — same `UPDATE ... WHERE name = 'Para-Medical'` pattern as 0033–0035,
      applied on top of all three.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green; live-verified with
  Playwright (screenshotted) — guest Home screen confirmed showing "Vitals Monitoring and medication
  compliance." as the plain summary and "Vitals Monitoring (BP, Sugar, O2)" as the first bullet, zero
  console errors.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0036_para_medical_split_bp_sugar_o2.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this
  environment — same still-outstanding 0033–0035 gap as every round before it.

## Change round — `bookings_full`: one flat GET returning patient + dependent + service + caregiver together (user, 2026-08-22)
Follow-up to the backend-demo work: user pasted a generic "how REST APIs work" explainer (from elsewhere)
and asked for the "one GET containing everything" idea it described (point 5 — a combined view/RPC instead
of one call per table) built for real. Since PostgREST only serves plain `GET` for tables/views (an RPC
needs `POST`), built it as a **view**, not a function, so it stays a genuine one-line `GET` with no extra
steps.

- [x] **New migration `0037_bookings_full_view.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`, header bumped to
      "0001–0037", inserted right after the RLS policy block so the view's `left join`s can reference
      already-defined tables/policies): `public.bookings_full` — one row per booking, joined with the
      account holder's name/phone/age, the dependent's name/relationship/age/contact (if the booking is
      for one), and the assigned caregiver's name/phone. Mirrors `shared/src/hooks.ts`'s existing
      `BOOKING_WITH_NAMES_SELECT` nested-select shape exactly, just reachable as a plain `GET
      /rest/v1/bookings_full` instead of a client-constructed nested query.
- [x] **`with (security_invoker = true)`** on the view — the one detail that makes this safe rather than a
      hole: without it, a Postgres view runs with its *creator's* privileges and would silently bypass
      RLS entirely (every booking, every patient, exposed to anyone with the anon key). With it (Postgres
      15+, which Supabase provisions), the view enforces RLS as the *calling* user — so it inherits
      `bk_select`'s existing household/staff scoping automatically. The view adds zero new access; it's
      strictly a more convenient shape for data the caller could already see one join at a time.
      `grant select ... to authenticated` — no `anon` grant, same boundary as every real table.
- [x] **`scripts/demo-backend.js`** gained a 9th search option — "Appointments, combined (patient +
      dependent + service + caregiver in one row)" — pointed at the new view, so it's directly explorable
      through the same login → search loop as the other 8 tables.
- Verified: `node --check scripts/demo-backend.js` clean. **Not run against a live database** — this
  environment has no Docker/Postgres, same standing limitation as every migration in this project; the
  view definition was checked by hand against the existing `BOOKING_WITH_NAMES_SELECT` shape and the
  established `bookings`/`profiles`/`family_members` schema/RLS rather than executed.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0037_bookings_full_view.sql` (or the
  refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project — until it does,
  `GET /rest/v1/bookings_full` doesn't exist there yet (404/"relation does not exist").

## Change round — self-selected Admin/Leaf Node roles now gated by a fixed team name (user, 2026-08-22)
User already had a dedicated Admin account (`VAgeWell_Care_qcrah`, from an earlier round) and asked for
the same for Care Assistant (`VAgeWell_Care_ln`) — then clarified via a follow-up that "except this
username no one should login" meant a real restriction: the self-select-role signup door (0013 —
Caregiver/Admin → Sign up, picks a role, granted instantly) should stop letting *anyone* claim Admin or
Leaf Node; only these two specific identities should ever be able to.

- [x] **New migration `0038_gate_self_selected_roles_by_name.sql`** (mirrored into `install_all.sql`,
      header bumped to "0001–0038"): `handle_new_user()`'s role-selection check now requires the signed-up
      `full_name` to exactly match a fixed pair — `'VAgeWell_Care_qcrah'` for `requested_role = 'admin'`,
      `'VAgeWell_Care_ln'` for `requested_role = 'leaf_node'`. Any other name (or no name) requesting
      either role falls through to `'patient'`, the same fallback an unrecognized role value already had
      — no new failure mode, just a stricter match. `full_name` is now read once into a local
      `v_full_name` variable and reused for both the check and the INSERT, instead of re-reading
      `raw_user_meta_data` a second time.
- **Stated plainly, not glossed over:** this is a **coordination gate, not real authentication** — the
  name is visible in the UI and guessable, not a secret credential. It stops a random stranger from
  picking "Admin" on the signup form and getting it instantly (which the door allowed unconditionally
  since 0013), but anyone who happens to know or guess the exact name string can still self-elevate. If
  stronger protection is ever wanted, the next step up would be a real invite-code/token check instead of
  a fixed name string — flagged here, not built, since it wasn't asked for.
- **Not changed:** `set_user_role()` (the existing admin-only promotion RPC) — already properly gated to
  admin callers, untouched; this round only affects the *self-service* signup path. Mobile app code is
  also untouched — `AuthModal`'s existing "Registering as" picker still sends `requested_role` exactly as
  before, the gate is entirely server-side.
- **Needs the user's machine, same as every prior migration:** `0038_gate_self_selected_roles_by_name.sql`
  (or the refreshed `install_all.sql`) has not run against the live Supabase project from this environment
  — until it does, the self-select door still grants Admin/Leaf Node to any name, same as before this
  round.

## Change round — reverted the single-dropdown time picker back to Hour/Minute/AM-PM (user, 2026-08-22)
User asked, via a clarifying question, to revert the single combined "06:00 AM"-style dropdown (built two
rounds ago) back to the original three-control layout — a 96-entry list turned out to be more tedious to
scroll through than three small pickers, even though the three-control layout is visually less "one box."

- [x] **`mobile/src/components/ui/TimeField.tsx`** restored to the Hour `SelectSheet` (12 options) +
      Minute `SelectSheet` (4 options: 00/15/30/45) + AM/PM `ChoiceChips` layout — the exact shape it had
      before being collapsed into one `timeSlots()`-backed dropdown. Still no business-hours restriction
      (that removal stands, unrelated to this layout choice) — `combineTime()` always emits a valid
      15-minute-boundary `"HH:MM"` regardless of which of the three controls changed.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Not visually
  verified** — the Appointment form's time picker needs a signed-in session this environment can't reach;
  the revert is a straightforward file restore to a previously-verified-working version.

## Bugfix — system dark mode was leaking into every customer-facing screen (user, 2026-08-22)
User's real-device screenshot showed the guest Home screen's service cards rendering with a dark-navy
background and low-contrast text — screens that were never designed for dark mode at all (cream
`bg-authbg` background, purple/teal branding). Root cause: `useThemePreference()` — the hook that forces
NativeWind's `colorScheme` to `"light"` by default (persisted admin preference wins if the sidebar's
toggle was ever used) — was only ever called from inside `AdminSidebar.tsx`. It never ran at all for
anyone who hadn't opened that specific admin screen: every patient, and every ops user before their first
visit there. With nothing ever explicitly setting the scheme, NativeWind silently fell back to the
device's own system dark-mode setting, and every `dark:` Tailwind variant across the app (added for the
admin/ops toggle specifically) bled through onto screens that had no matching light-mode-only design intent.

- [x] **`mobile/App.tsx`**: `useThemePreference()` is now called once at the app root, alongside the font
      loading — runs for every screen, every role, the instant the app mounts, not just after navigating
      into the admin sidebar. `AdminSidebar.tsx`'s own call is unchanged (it still needs the returned
      `colorScheme`/`toggle` for its own UI); calling the hook from two places is harmless — NativeWind's
      `useColorScheme()` is shared/global state, not per-instance, so both calls read and drive the same
      underlying value.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Live-verified with
  Playwright using a `colorScheme: 'dark'` emulated browser context** (the closest simulation available in
  this environment to a real phone with system dark mode on) — confirmed the service card's background
  computed to `rgb(255, 255, 255)` (white) even under emulated OS dark mode, screenshotted showing the
  correct light appearance throughout. Zero console errors.

## Change round — pushed to GitHub, first Vercel deploy of the mobile app's web build (user, 2026-08-22)
User asked to `git push` and deploy to Vercel for testing. This session's entire accumulated work (i18n,
Google sign-in, booking flow rework, dark-mode fix, migrations 0030–0038, etc. — everything logged above
since the last push) was committed as one commit and pushed to `origin/main`
(`https://github.com/maheshwarihit/mobile-app.git`), landing as commit `5b77929`.

- [x] **Did NOT reuse the repo's existing `.vercel/project.json` link** — it points to a project literally
      named `"web"`, last deployed 14 days before this round (i.e. before the `web/` Next.js portal was
      deleted in the "single mobile app" merge). Reusing it would have either broken or confusingly
      overwritten whatever that project currently serves. Deployed the mobile app's web build as a
      **new**, separate Vercel project instead (`vagewell-web-deploy`, same team/account,
      `https://vagewell-web-deploy.vercel.app`), built from a copy made **outside** the repo (so Vercel
      CLI couldn't walk up and find the old `.vercel` link) rather than from inside the repo tree.
- [x] **Found and fixed a real deploy-breaking bug in the process, not just this session's demo build**:
      the first deploy attempt rendered a **blank page** — root-caused to Vercel's CLI silently excluding
      any folder literally named `node_modules` from the upload (a built-in default, not configurable via
      `.vercelignore`). Expo's web export happens to name a real asset folder
      `assets/node_modules/@expo-google-fonts/...` (mirroring the font package's own path for its
      asset-hashing scheme) — those font files never made it to Vercel, `useFonts()` in `App.tsx` never
      resolved, and `if (!fontsLoaded) return null` meant the whole app rendered nothing, forever, with no
      console error at all (only 404s on the font requests). Fixed by renaming
      `assets/node_modules` → `assets/vendor-fonts` in the built output and patching the one JS bundle
      file that referenced the old path (19 occurrences, confirmed zero remaining) before redeploying —
      **this same rename/patch step will be needed on every future deploy** to Vercel (or any host with
      the same default `node_modules`-folder exclusion) until Expo's own asset-hashing naming changes;
      not yet automated into a script, done by hand this round.
- Verified: redeployed build live-checked with Playwright — zero console errors, zero failed requests,
  screenshotted showing the Choose Language screen rendering correctly with the hero background image and
  both fonts visibly applied.
- **For the user:** the live testing link is **https://vagewell-web-deploy.vercel.app**. The old `"web"`
  Vercel project (`web-kappa-brown-gettx9v7gj.vercel.app`) was left completely untouched — worth deleting
  it from the Vercel dashboard if it's confirmed dead, or renaming/repurposing it, but that's your call,
  not done here.

## Change round — client-side name check on the Admin/Care Assistant sign-up form (user, 2026-08-22)
Follow-up to 0038 (the DB-side name gate): the trigger silently downgrades a mismatched name to
`'patient'` rather than erroring, so someone who picked Admin/Care Assistant with the wrong name would
complete a real OTP send + verify and only discover the mismatch by quietly landing in the wrong shell —
confusing and wastes a real OTP. User asked for the name to be enforced ("compulsory") on the signup form
itself.

- [x] **`mobile/src/components/feature/AuthModal.tsx`**: new `OPS_ROLE_REQUIRED_NAME` map (`admin` →
      `'VAgeWell_Care_qcrah'`, `leaf_node` → `'VAgeWell_Care_ln'` — must stay in sync with migration 0038
      by hand, flagged in a comment since there's no shared constant between the DB and the client for
      this). `sendOtp()` now checks the typed Full Name against the map for whichever role is selected
      *before* sending anything — a mismatch shows `auth.error.nameMismatch` inline and never calls
      Supabase at all, so no OTP is spent on a doomed attempt. New translation key added (English + Tamil).
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green. **Live-verified end
  to end with Playwright** against the real Supabase project (this check runs entirely client-side, so it
  was safe to test for real): typing a wrong name blocked immediately with the mismatch error, no network
  call made; typing the correct name (`VAgeWell_Care_ln`) passed the check cleanly and proceeded to the
  next real step (hit "number already has an account" only because the test number used was already
  registered — expected, unrelated to this fix). Zero console errors throughout.

## Change round — pushed + redeployed the name gate; added a repeatable deploy script (user, 2026-08-22)
User tested the still-not-yet-deployed name gate on the live Vercel link and (correctly) saw it not
applied yet. Committed + pushed the AuthModal change (commit `d5bb796`), then redeployed.

- [x] **New `scripts/deploy-vercel.sh`** — automates what was done by hand for the first deploy: build the
      web export, copy it outside the repo (so Vercel CLI can't walk up and find the root's stale `"web"`
      project link), rename `assets/node_modules` → `assets/vendor-fonts` and patch every file referencing
      the old path (the Vercel `node_modules`-folder upload exclusion from the previous round), then
      deploy. **Explicitly writes a `.vercel/project.json` pointing at the known `vagewell-web-deploy`
      project ID** (`prj_DTYvXANLfN1IW9slum9wBksr8x8E`) into the temp deploy directory before deploying —
      needed because each run's `mktemp` directory has a different random name, and Vercel's CLI matches
      an unlinked directory to a project *by directory name* on first deploy; without the explicit link, every
      run would have created a brand new project instead of updating this one.
- Verified: ran the new script for real, redeployed to the same `https://vagewell-web-deploy.vercel.app`
  URL (confirmed same project, not a new one). Live-verified with Playwright against the actual production
  URL: typing "Suji" as Care Assistant now shows "The name doesn't match the registered name for this
  role." — screenshotted. Zero console errors.
- **For the user:** future redeploys are just `bash scripts/deploy-vercel.sh` from the repo root — no more
  manual copy/rename/patch steps.

## Change round — guest Home screen now shows per-service icons, matching the Services tab (user, 2026-08-22)
User noticed every service card on the guest ("View as Guest") Home screen showed the same stethoscope
icon, unlike the signed-in Services tab, which already uses a distinct icon per service
(`iconForService()` — Para-Medical/Stethoscope, Mental Wellbeing/Brain, Nutrition/Apple, Physio/Activity).

- [x] **`mobile/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`**: replaced the hardcoded `<Stethoscope>` icon with
      `iconForService(s.name)` (the same lookup `ServicesScreen.tsx` already uses), computed per card
      inside the `SEED_SERVICES.map()`. Dropped the now-unused direct `Stethoscope` import.
- Verified: `mobile` `tsc --noEmit` clean; `expo export --platform web` bundle green; live-verified with
  Playwright — screenshotted the guest Home screen showing Para-Medical with the stethoscope icon and
  Mental Wellbeing with the brain icon (previously both showed stethoscope), zero console errors.
